New Armada and Island cards enrich the game and increase the interaction between players.</p>\r\n<p>The flow of the game is slightly changed, but the victory conditions remain identical to those of the base game of 7 Wonders.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of each Age, the players each get a hand of 8 cards. They will play an extra card during each Age. At any time a Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue card is played, the player will be able to move the ship of the same color one space, and&nbsp;access to various&nbsp;advantages, such as discovering islands, military power, victory points, etc. There's an extra cost you need to pay to do this, and can be either resources or coins.</p>\r\n<h5>Set up</h5>\r\n<p>The set up remains pretty much the same, you add the same amount armada card to each age as there are players, in the same way the black cards are added in Cities.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>islands</em> are shuffled according to their age and put in 3 face-down decks.</p>\r\n<p>Give all players a fleet board, which is to be placed next to the wonder, and each player receives ships of each color; Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544532993/7AR_Cards_18.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Card with Naval ability\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">This card is worth 5 VPs, and lets you move a ship of any color forward</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h5>Rule changes</h5>\r\n<p>There are some slight changes to the rules and some changes to some of the game semantics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Military conflict is now referred to as&nbsp;<em>Ground Conflict.</em></li>\r\n<li>Shields are now&nbsp;<em>Ground Shields.</em></li>\r\n<li>The new cards are called&nbsp;<em>Armada Cards.</em></li>\r\n<li>After the Ground Conflict, there is now a&nbsp;<em>Naval Conflict</em>&nbsp;stage, where you make naval warfare against ALL other players.</li>\r\n<li>You may now move a ship on your fleet board when you discard a card, instead of gaining the 3 coins.</li>\r\n<li>There is now a cap of 10 points for the guild cards.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><input name=\"IL_IN_ARTICLE\" type=\"hidden\" /></p>\r\n<h5>The fleet boards</h5>\r\n<p>This is the biggest gameplay changer, but it's pretty straight forward.</p>\r\n<p>A player who has played a Red, Yellow, Blue, or Green card will have the option to pay an additional cost in order to move the ship of the same color one space on the fleet board, which will grant the player benefits of different types (Red for military, blue for more VPs, yellow for money, green for islands).</p>\r\n<p>You can also discard a card to move a boat of any color. Building on your wonder also makes you able to move a boat of a certain color.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid rounded float-right\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544533010/7AR-EN01_Cards_Islands_1.jpg\" alt=\"Island\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">A basic Island worth 3 VP. There are more advanced ones. :)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h5>The islands</h5>\r\n<p>The islands are discovered with the Green tack on the fleet board and give you access to private resources, Ground Shields, Naval Shields, and other good stuff. You'll get to choose one of 4 different islands.</p>\r\n<h5>Naval combat</h5>\r\n<p>After each age, you will resolve ground combat just like before, but there will also be Naval combat, where everyone participates. It pretty much works like this; Everyone compares their naval strengths, and the winner gets X amount of VP, and the runner up gets a bit less. In bigger player counts even the third place gets a couple of points. Of course, this scales with the ages, much like ground combat. However, the one with the LEAST Naval strength gets a lot of negative VP points, so skipping Naval Power altogether might not be a good idea.</p>\r\n<p>This expansion also lets you do ground combat against non-neighboring civilizations on 4+ player games, with special cards. Cool stuff!</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid rounded float-right\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1570016613/armada30.jpg\" alt=\"7 wonder naval combat\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">The naval combat scoreboard.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h3>OPINION</h3>\r\n<h4>The good:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This expansion was bound to add more interaction between players, for example, to wake war on your non-neighbors in 4+ player games, which it succeeds with.</li>\r\n<li>One extra card per age is nice, which makes it 9 in total with Cities.</li>\r\n<li>More paths to victory, thanks to the&nbsp;fleet boards, and the islands.</li>\r\n<li>The&nbsp;fleet boards different, (and with different wonder track) make Wonder + board pairing a unique challenge to solve.</li>\r\n<li>Straightforward rules, if you have played 7W before this will not be a problem to get started with.</li>\r\n<li>You now have another option except the 3 coins when discarding a card, which is nice.</li>\r\n<li>The introduction of the 10VP cap on the Guild Cards.. Very welcome!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>The bad, sort of:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The science cards (the green cards) might make going for 1 type&nbsp;of science stronger than collecting the sets.</li>\r\n<li>It might be hard to keep track of the opponent's naval strengths.</li>\r\n<li>Ship miniatures tend to fall off the tracks from time to time. They are kind of fiddly.</li>\r\n<li>Adds playtime, especially with new players.&nbsp;This is probably the biggest drawback.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n<p>This expansion makes good on its promises on increased interaction and adds a lot of content without slowing the game too much, a&nbsp;very welcome addition to the family!

Return the remaining 4 to the box.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You add the expansions 6 new station master tiles to the base game's, shuffle them, and put 5 of them on the original spaces, and 2 of them on the new spaces. The remaining 4 goes right next to city of New York.</p>\r\n<p>Every player get an \"Auxiliary add-on\" to their private board, place their additional disc on the correct space, and add the 15 <em>branchlets</em>, which are used to populate the&nbsp;towns with houses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>New actions/rules</strong></p>\r\n<p>The new auxiliary action lets you place a branchlet on one of the towns&nbsp;you have <em>access to</em>&nbsp;(if at least one rail track connects it directly to at least one of the following):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the Kansas city office or</li>\r\n<li>a city crest that has one of your discs or</li>\r\n<li>another town square that has one of your branchlets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"a medium town with a tile\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543491465/town.jpg\" alt=\"a medium town with a tile\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" /></p>\r\n<p>Placing branchlets either costs you money, gets you money, or gives you an immediate action, and depening on the size of the town, may give you the ability to upgrade the station in the town etc. Placing branchlets on a medium town also triggers the effects on the medium town tile, for an example moving your train 3 spaces forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"Auxiliary add-ons, bell spaces, and branchlets\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543493471/auxi.jpg\" alt=\"Auxiliary add-ons, bell spaces, and branchlets\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" /></p>\r\n<p>Clearing the spaces where the branclets are on you private board also gives you access to to the <em>bell spaces,&nbsp;</em>which gives you more actions and&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;more points at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>There is also some new abilites on the cities when delivering cattle to them, adding even more variety.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #5b616a; font-family: 'Fira Sans', Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; white-space: pre; background-color: #e4ebf1;\">&nbsp;</span><strong>&nbsp;The good stuff:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adds alot of variety.</li>\r\n<li>Adds more mechanics to a game already packed with them, in a smooth way.</li>\r\n<li>Adds alternatives to Kansas the first two rounds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>The bad, sort of:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New stuff to a game already packed with things to do might not be ideal for new players.</li>\r\n<li>Adds a tiny bit up set up time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\r\n<p>Like stated above this expansion really adds alot more variety, mechanics and general awesomeness to an already awesome game.</p>\r\n<p>If you are a fan of the base game, this one is a no-brainer as far as we're concerned, a great expansion for GWT.</p>\r\n<p>There rules can be found<a title=\"The rulebook\" href=\"https://boardgame-news.com/rules/great_western_trail_rails_to_the_north_rules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> here:&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>AVAILIBILITY</strong></p>\r\n<p>The game has been hard to come buy, but fear not!

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your \"inner circle\", which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"The game components\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543713900/pic2930107.jpg\" alt=\"The game components\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-right\">The game components, not for everyone..</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>Set up.</h4>\r\n<p>The set up is fast once you get a hang of it, the only problem can be the troop components, which can be a bit fiddly.</p>\r\n<p>You place a number of neutral troops on the map, depending on the number of players.</p>\r\n<p>You shuffle together 2 half-decks of cards, to form a central deck of 80 cards. You will turn 5 cards from this deck face up to&nbsp;form a \"marketplace\", from which you recruit, \"buy\", cards.</p>\r\n<p>You give each player a starter deck&nbsp;with 10 cards, 3 soldiers and 7 nobles each. The soldiers generate Power and the nobles generate Influence. Power is used to placing troops on the map, deploying spies, assassinating enemy troops, and getting rid of enemy spies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Influence is used for buying cards from the marketplace mentioned earlier.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"Some closeups of cards\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543713900/pic3118085.jpg\" alt=\"Some closeups of cards\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Closeup of a couple of cards</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>Gameplay</h4>\r\n<p>On your turn, you play your cards from your hand, add up your Power to use various actions on the map, use your influence to recruit cards from the marketplace. As cards from the marketplace are recruited, they are immediately replaced with new ones from the central deck.</p>\r\n<p>The marketplace cards obviously have Influence and Power on them, but also special abilities which you cannot use with Power. There are 5 different themes of cards;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Ambition</em>, these cards excel at recruiting more minions (cards) and creating a strong <em>inner circle</em>. The inner circle lets you remove a card from your deck and put it in your inner circle, where it might be worth more points in the end.<br /><em>Conquest</em>, as the name suggests, these cards are best for taking over the map of the Underdark.<br /><em>Malice</em>, flexible cards that are best at assassinations.<br /><em>Guile</em>, used mainly for spies.<br /><em>Obedience</em>, focus on Power and Influence.</p>\r\n<p>Players take turns fighting over key points on the map, sending spies to establish presence to cities, recruiting various monsters and minions from the market place.

In fact, one could say this is a perfect filler game (You know, the kind of games you play between games or when you are waiting for someone. Or perhaps as the last game when the hour is getting late).<br />-One would be right.<br />Biblios takes about 20-30 minutes to play including set up, it's easy to teach, packs a great amount of replayability, and appeals to newbies and hardcore gamers alike. Sounds good? Well, sit back and enjoy this review of Biblios.</p>\r\n<h4>Components</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 Value Board</li>\r\n<li>5 Dice</li>\r\n<li>87 Playing Cards</li>\r\n<li>2 Reference Cards</li>\r\n<li>Rules</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Overview</h4>\r\n<p>Biblios is a set-collection card game in which you are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books.&nbsp;<br />To do so, you need to collect different types of scrolls, scribes, manuscripts, and other items needed for such a library.. These are represented by different types of cards. <br />You will also need money, for buying more of these items at auctions, and you will need to be in good standing with the bishops. These are also represented by cards from the same stack.</p>\r\n<p>The game is divided into two phases, \"The donation phase\"&nbsp; and \"The auction phase\", with the first one taking up roughly 2/3 of the playing time.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the game, players compare their score in the different types of categories, and the winner gets as many points as the die in that category is showing.</p>\r\n<h4>Set up</h4>\r\n<p>This part is a breeze, you shuffle the cards, removing a certain amount of face-down cards depending on player count, put down the dice on their correspondent spots, with the number 3 pointing upwards. Boom, you are ready to go.</p>\r\n<h4>Gameplay</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Donation Phase: </strong> Players take turns drawing cards from the stack. On a players turn he/she has to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Take <strong>one</strong> card and add it to his/her hand.</li>\r\n<li>Take <strong>one</strong> card and add it face down to the auction pile.</li>\r\n<li>Take <strong>the same amount of cards as there are other players</strong>, put them face up on the table.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The players draw one card at the time and have to decide what to do which each. This is a very simple mechanic in which phase 1 revolves around, and it's brilliant;<br /> -Oh, you drew a <em>pretty</em> good card for your collection, hmm what to do? Give it to the opponent, add it to your hand, and therefore forfeiting the rest of the cards this turn, or putting it face down in the action pile?<br />These are the choices that will haunt you when it's your turn and it's great, the feeling when you've managed to give your opponents the worst cards, get the best one yourself, and the second-best in the auction pile is simply amazing. Press-your-luck mechanic at its finest.</p>\r\n<p>So, what is a good card you wonder? Well, this game is about collecting the most points of a given category (color), to gain the dice of that corresponding category, and the dice determines the score.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544123253/pic2724710.jpg\" alt=\"the dice of each color\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">In this example, whoever gets the most points in the&nbsp;brown&nbsp;category, wins the&nbsp;brown&nbsp;dice. At the moment it's worth&nbsp;5 points.&nbsp;</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>There are also cards that raise or lower a category's status with the Bishop. Mechanic wise this means you can raise or lower the value of one or two dice. These cards are extremely important at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>Auction Phase: The auction pile is shuffled and then the current player draws the top card and makes a bid for that card. The next player has an opportunity to bid higher or fold. The player with the highest bid wins the card. In other words, a pretty standard auction procedure.</p>\r\n<p>When bidding for Bishop cards or category cards, the players use their money cards. When bidding for money cards, the players use a different currency; A number of cards they are willing to discard from their hand to gain that money card.<br />For example, player X knows he/she cannot possibly win the orange category, so it might be worth discarding the two cards he has for some more money.&nbsp;<br />At this stage, the players have a pretty good idea on how they are doing in a certain color, because they know what cards they have put in the auction pile, and they have some idea what the opponents have, thanks to the cards put face up in phase 1.</p>\r\n<p>This goes on until the deck is depleted.</p>\r\n<p>The players compare colors one by one, and the winner of each color gets the die. The dice might be worth 1 to 6 points depending on how the players have used the Bishop cards. So you might pull off a win even though you just won 1 color.<br />Obviously, the player with the total amount of points on their dice is the winner.</p>\r\n<h3>OPINION</h3>\r\n<h4>The good</h4>\r\n<p>Very easy to teach.</p>\r\n<p>Very fast gameplay.</p>\r\n<p>Great replayability.</p>\r\n<p>The Drafting/Press your luck combo in phase 1 is superb.</p>\r\n<p>Scales very well, good fun with 2, 3, or 4 players. There is also an official variant for 5 players by the designer (see below!).</p>\r\n<p>The suspense lingers to the very end.</p>\r\n<h4>The bad</h4>\r\n<p>Some think the theme is \"pasted on\".</p>\r\n<p>The quality of the cards could be better, easily remedied with sleeves, though. We recommend the <a title=\"Sleeves for Biblios\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2z02qtu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantasy Flight BG Sleeves</a>. The game consists of 87 cards, so you will need 2 packs of these. Make sure you get the 63.5 x 88mm sleeves for Biblios.</p>\r\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n<p>To sum it up, Biblios is one of the best card drafting games out there, and one of the best filler games. Highly Recommended!<br />Rating <strong>9/10.</strong></p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Biblios at Amazon\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MW46RU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=boardgamene01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004MW46RU&amp;linkId=0d30cb802cddfe9d6aa4478189049faa\" target=\"_blank\">The game is about 20 dollars/euros, and it can be found here.</a></p>\r\n<p>Biblios rules&nbsp;are found <a title=\"Link to the rulebook\" href=\"http://www.iellogames.com/downloads/Biblios_rules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

Example: I play church card with two dice plus 1. I change colored dice in two categories up 1, then change white dice in two categories up 1.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A player is not forced to change white dice, but can only change colored dice if she wishes. (I.e., does not need to use full power).<br />Second place in each category scores the white dice.<br />One cannot turn the white dice to be valued higher than a colored die.<br />Likewise one cannot turn a colored die lower than a white die.<br />In the case that the colored die and a white die are the same in a category, the white die is automatically lowered by 1 (unless both dice are at 1).</p>\r\n</blockquote>"},"image":{"public_id":"b7fvugq3yqx8skcsx8ih","version":{"$numberInt":"1544050594"},"signature":"6143753fda896923dc18c0dda1947c21090994ce","width":{"$numberInt":"405"},"height":{"$numberInt":"600"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544050594/b7fvugq3yqx8skcsx8ih.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544050594/b7fvugq3yqx8skcsx8ih.jpg"},"author":{"$oid":"5bf88dbd1971ad70901b248f"},"publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1544050800000"}},"metadescription":"A no-frills type of review of the card game Biblios, THE perfect filler game if you ask us.

We both know you are here to learn about On Mars, not about the author of this review. Here&rsquo;s the skinny; I am <strong>William Aukes</strong>, an avid board gamer and first-time reviewer from northeast Iowa. Over the last 5 months, I have had the privilege of being one of the playtesters for On Mars, and I&nbsp;want to share my experiences with the game in hopes that it may offer some insight into whether or not you make the choice to boldly go in on <strong>Vital Lacerda&rsquo;s</strong> next&nbsp;masterpiece.</p>\r\n<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>\r\n<p>On Mars, simply put, is an action selection game. It is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases; the colonization phase and shuttle phase. During colonization phases, players will select actions depending on which side of the board they are on, either in orbit or the colony. The shuttle phase allows players to travel via public or private ship, between the colony and orbit, opening up new actions to select in subsequent colonization phases. The public shuttle moves (alternating in direction) on a dedicated schedule based on the advancement of the colony&rsquo;s Life Support System (LSS) (which I will briefly highlight later). Players are competing to be the most renowned contributors to the development of the new colony on Mars. By construct buildings, hiring scientists, researching technology, completing contracts, and scouring the surface for anything that may be useful in their endeavors, players work to score the most Opportunity Points (OP), signifying their efforts in developing and sustaining this new Martian colony. The game ends after players complete a predetermined number of public objective cards (based on variant and player count). The player with the most OP is declared the winner.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1548189159/pic4140184.jpg\" alt=\"The board\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">The board</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h3>GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS</h3>\r\n<p>Below is not a comprehensive review of all of the components and possible actions in the game. Rather, it is meant to highlight some key aspects of the game and simple turn structure.</p>\r\n<h4>Colonization Phase</h4>\r\n<p>During the colonization phase, players take turns selecting an action on their respective side of the board (orbit or colony). Some actions require colonists to be placed on public action spots, while others are able to be taken without the use of colonists. Action spaces become more expensive as other players occupy them. In addition to their main actions, players also have the ability to take a single executive action. Executive action abilities are unlocked on the left side of your personal player board. Once they are unlocked, players can spend a specific number of crystals to take that action. Crystals can be harvested from the surface of the planet (using your rover), taken from storage (as a main action), and earned by completing actions on the public mission cards. Another source of executive actions is advanced buildings. Players, while in orbit, can take ownership of advanced building blueprints as their main action. Once constructed in the colony, these buildings offer additional executive action options for players at the cost of 2 crystals. While on the colony side, players can hire scientists to work for them. There are 6 scientists available in the game, each one specializing in a specific discipline corresponding to a building type. Once hired, scientists can be used on matching constructed advanced buildings (your own or another players) to make those executive actions free (rather than spending those precious crystals).</p>\r\n<h4>Shuttle Phase</h4>\r\n<p>Once all players have taken their respective turns, the colonization phase is over and the shuttle phase begins. During the shuttle phase, the public shuttle will move one space toward the opposite side of the board it is on. If the shuttle moves from one side of the board to the other, players may choose to travel with it to the opposite side of the board. At the beginning of the game, the public shuttle moves between colony and orbit every other turn. As the Life Support System increases, the public shuttle travels between orbit less frequently, so players must be precise with the timing of when to travel with the public shuttle and when to use their private ships to travel. After the shuttle phase, players move back into the colonization phase, selecting actions on their respective side of the board.</p>\r\n<h4>Life Support System</h4>\r\n<p>The Life Support System (LSS) is the public indicator for how the colony is developing throughout the game as well as the needs for the colony to advance to the next level. The LSS is, essentially, four columns representing the construction of necessary buildings corresponding to specific resources (Energy, Water, Plants, and Oxygen). Once each respective column meets the next threshold, the LSS level increases, thus changing the state of the game. The LSS level dictates how frequently the public shuttle travels as well as how many public mission cards must be completed to trigger the end of the game. As the LSS increases, the colony becomes more self-sufficient and less reliant on supplies from orbit. When players construct building tiles of a specific resource, they increase the marker corresponding to that resource on the LSS and gain a reward for doing so. The reward for each column is variable and will be randomly drawn at the start of the game.</p>\r\n<h4>Player Boards</h4>\r\n<p>The player board acts as a control center for your operations in the game. On your player board is a hexagonal grid that represents your personal technology advancement. One of the orbit side main actions is researching and developing technology. With this action, players select technology tiles to place on their personal board. Technology tiles increase a player&rsquo;s ability to take certain actions depending on the tile and level it is at. While in orbit, players may choose to upgrade their technology. By paying a cost, players advance their technology and increase its abilities. Your player board also contains a storage area for resources. Each player starts out with the ability to hold a maximum of two of each type of resource. As you expand your personal habitat on the surface of Mars, you unlock the ability to store more goods and house more colonists. Player boards also house your fleet of ships. Ships allow you to travel independently of the public shuttle (during the shuttle phases) and increase your population when you choose the action that allows you to add another one to your fleet. Ships begin on your board covering the executive actions I mentioned earlier. Welcoming a new ship allows players to choose a ship depending on which executive action they would like to add to their arsenal. Players also control a rover and robots throughout the game. One of the main actions of the colony side is moving your rover and robots. Rovers are used to explore the surface for useful materials. Robots are the builders for your operation. New buildings must be built in spaces adjacent to one of your robots, so be mindful of how you maneuver them to set yourself up for success.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1555059870/VFg3cl8.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype game in action\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Prototype game in action</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h3>THEME</h3>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, the &ldquo;Mars&rdquo; theme is that dead horse designers keep whacking, unapologetically. On Mars, however, injected life back into a theme I was ready to bury out back next to a headstone that reads &ldquo;Here lies trading in the Mediterranean&rdquo;. John Noble Wilford put it nicely when he wrote &ldquo;Mars tugs at the human imagination like no other planet. With a force mightier than gravity, it attracts the eye to the shimmering red presence in the clear night sky...&rdquo;. I believe it&rsquo;s the hope and possibility that we are just an arms reach from ideas once held as science fiction. All of us are glossy-eyed children with big dreams. If you are familiar with Vital&rsquo;s games, then you likely know that his design process predicates itself on theme. Mechanics are then sculpted to represent the thematic interpretation the game sets out to achieve. On Mars is no exception to this process. The feedback loop of resources represents the essence of homeostasis necessary for a colony to thrive on this strange planet. Colonists are needed to mine ore from the planet. Ore is used to creating energy. Energy is harnessed to melt ice caps to collect water. Water is used to cultivate plants. Plants will produce oxygen. Oxygen will sustain human life and an expanding population. The circle is complete and continuous and is the core driver of the different subsystems in the game. Players must account for the interconnectedness of these resources as they make choices throughout the game. The colony players are constructing on Mars is heavily reliant on supplies from the International Space Station orbiting the Red Planet at the beginning of the game. As the game progresses and the colony becomes more self-sustaining, players make fewer trips to orbit and instead rely on the materials and knowledge they have in the colony. On Mars is fresh. It is unique. And ultimately, a pragmatic interpretation of what the development of the first colony on Mars might look like.</p>\r\n<h4>Game Length (1.5-3 hours)</h4>\r\n<p>On Mars will take approximately 1.5-3 hours to play, depending on player count. In my online testing, full 4 player games were reliably within the 2-3 hour range so I would anticipate that time being reduced approximately 10 minutes per player for an in-person game (due to the fiddliness of Tabletopia). We had a 4 player game finish right at 2 hours, so I could envision experienced players being able to finish a live game in under 2 hours. Despite its length, On Mars is not plodding experience. The longer games I participated in never felt as such. Players are constantly engaged, outside of their turn. However, if the game length does sound daunting, On Mars offers a &ldquo;First Colonist&rdquo; variant that allows players to play through the game in an abbreviated version, which is still true to the full game&rsquo;s natural arc.</p>\r\n<h4>Weight (Medium Heavy)</h4>\r\n<p>On Mars is thick, but don&rsquo;t let the 4.5+ complexity ranking scare you. Learning the rules of the game is not a tremendously difficult task. It is understanding the interconnectivity of the games&rsquo; subsystems that requires work from players. It took me a full playthrough before I was comfortable with my understanding of the game. After that, the nuances of the mechanics began to blossom and the game really opens up to players. I would hesitate to suggest On Mars for the casual gamer. If this is your first jump into Vital&rsquo;s work, I would consider starting with <a title=\"Vinhos Deluxe Edition Amazon\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2V2ZRBo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vinhos Deluxe Edition</a>. That being said, if you are willing to make the upfront investment in learning this game, it is one that will reward your time and effort exponentially.</p>\r\n<h4>Player Count</h4>\r\n<p>1p- Good*<br /> 2p- Good*<br /> 3p- Great<br /> 4p- Great</p>\r\n<p>On Mars shines at higher player counts. My favorite playthroughs were 3-4 player games, where players are constantly appraising each other&rsquo;s tableaus, weighing the consequences of borrowing each other&rsquo;s technology or advanced buildings. Player interaction is what makes this game great. I would not say On Mars is optimized for 2 players. Nonetheless, I have played great games with the 2 player rules and plan to play mostly at this count, with my wife, when I have my hands on the final product. The basic solo game presents an interesting challenge, where players attempt to complete mission cards of varying difficulty. The solo game is crunchy and brain-burning (and only getting better as it is being developed).</p>\r\n<p><em>*Note: The solo and 2 player rules were still in development during the time of this review and are subject to change my final opinion. More advanced solo rules are being developed to recreate the player interaction present in the multiplayer games*</em></p>\r\n<h4>Replayability</h4>\r\n<p>Like the universe we reside in, replayability is without bounds. I cannot fathom how one could ever become bored of this game. Each new game will offer a unique board state with variability in the initial building locations of the colony, public and private mission cards, rewards for improving the Life Support System (LSS), and available starting advanced buildings. The combinations players will discovery through the use of scientists, advanced buildings, and their technology leaves this new world open for players to explore.</p>\r\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\r\n<p>On Mars is an artful matrimony of tactics and strategy. The game is tight but forgiving. Resources are scarce. Territory hexes fill up fast. Technology tiles are finite. Advanced buildings each have their own unique specialty. Each building type in the game has exactly one scientist that specializes in that discipline so snagging the right one to work in your advanced buildings can be game-changing. Time is one of the most important resources to manage in the game. Calculating when to travel between orbit and the colony is vital. So many consequences to consider when executing your plans. Like any astronaut who is worth their salt, players must be able to analyze the situation as it evolves before them and adapts to the ever-changing state of the game if they want to survive and come out on top.<br />The Kickstarter is over by now, and the game will be hitting the stores soon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On Mars is bold.

Here follows a review of Terraforming Mars board game and Terraforming Mars rules.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558291955/pic3125635.jpg\" alt=\"Terraforming Mars in action\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">Terraforming Mars board game in action</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h3>Overview of Gameplay</h3>\r\n<p>Each player is a corporation working to terraform the planet. The game ends when the three conditions needed to make Mars liveable are reached: raising the mean temperature from -30C to 8C, having 9% of the surface covered in oceans, and raising oxygen from 0% of the atmosphere to 14%. Players play cards and lay tiles on the planet's surface to raise each of these attributes, and score VP along the way. The game ends when all three of these conditions are met.</p>\r\n<p>Players either start with a beginning Corporation which gives 42 credits and 10 cards or if they are an experienced player, 'take 2 and choose 1' advanced corporation. Each advanced corporation gives some kind of extra ability such as a discount on playing certain kinds of cards, or rewards when other players take certain actions. The difference is the advanced corporations must pay 3 credits for each of their starting cards, so in effect, the beginner corporation starts with a 'bonus' 30 credits (10 cards x 3 credits each) worth of cards in their hand- but no extra ability. The rules recommend new players always take the beginner corporation, as they give a good bonus without having to know which specialization paths may work well.</p>\r\n<p>Each player has a mat in front of them with numerous resource areas: credits (money), steel, titanium, plants, electricity, and heat. Each resource area has a track for production of the resource, and an area to store the actual resource cubes themselves. Production of resources occur at the end of each round ('generation'), and the cubes go into the storage area for that resource.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558291955/pic2891980.jpg\" alt=\"Terraforming Mars player mat\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The player mat.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Money is used to pay the cost of cards. Steel is also used to pay for cards, but can only be played on cards that have a 'building' tag. However, each steel counts as 2 credits instead of 1, so a high steel production allows more building cards to be played easily. Titanium is like steel, except worth 3 credits each, but can only be used on cards with a 'space' tag. Plants are used to make greenery tiles. Electricity is used for certain cards and at the end of every round unused electricity is converted into heat. Heat is used to raise the planet's temperature.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever a global parameter (oxygen level, planet temperature, or ocean tile) is played, the player increases one 'TR' which is Terraforming Rating. TR provides two benefits: first, it counts as money production. So at the end of a round during production, players receive credits equal to their player mat money production, PLUS their TR rating. Secondly, each TR is worth one VP at the end of the game. Players start with 20 TR.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558291955/pic2897064.jpg\" alt=\"Terraforming Mars components\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The card in this example costs 20 credits to play, and have a steel tag.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Each round, players take turns taking 1 or 2 actions. Once a player takes no action and passes, they are out of the round until all players pass. On a player's turn they may play a card from their hand, claim a milestone or unlock an award, take a 'standard action' on the board, or play resources to either raise the temperature by one degree or make a greenery tile, which raises oxygen by 1% when played.</p>\r\n<p>Playing cards are the heart of the game. Each card has a cost and many have prerequisites, such as a minimum planet oxygen level before the card can be played. Some cards have maximum limits as well, such as the temperature must be below a certain threshold (e.g., the temperature must be lower than -12C). If a player has this card and wants to play it, they must time the play as these cards become effectively useless once the threshold limit is passed.</p>\r\n<p>Some cards make resources not on the mat but are created and stored on cards. These may be things like animals, bacteria, or space fighters. Cards that make and use these specialized resources are an opportunity to create 'mini-engines' that provide VP or other bonuses.</p>\r\n<p>Standard actions allow players to do certain actions without cards. Generally, these are 'overpaying' for actions that can be done cheaper with a card, but they don't require the card (and the associated money to acquire it). Examples are; Increase electricity generation by one, raise the temperature by one, or build a city. One important standard action is the ability to sell cards from your hand for 1 credit each.</p>\r\n<p>Claiming a Milestone allows players to earn 5 VP if they are the first player to reach a certain threshold: have 35 'TR', have 3 cities, have 3 greenery tiles, have 8 cards played with building tags, or have 16 cards in their hand. To claim a milestone a player pays 8 resources and locks it with their cube: they are now guaranteed these 5 VP at the end of the game. Only 3 of the 5 milestones can be claimed every game, so this turns into a bit of a race to grab them.</p>\r\n<p>Unlocking Awards works similarly, except players are not guaranteed to receive the bonus. Instead, a player pays a cost to 'unlock' an award: one which they think they are of course going to win at the end of the game. The awards are: most tiles played on the board, most heat cubes, most steel and titanium cubes (combined), most money production, and most cards with science tags played. Only three awards can be unlocked, and they become progressively more expensive to unlock. At the end of the game, whoever is the leader in the category gets 5 VP, and second place gets 2 VP- so it is quite possible that the person who unlocked the award does not take first place.</p>\r\n<p>Players can also as an action pay eight heat resources to raise the temperature one step (2C), or pay 8 plant resources to place a greenery tile. Placing greenery tiles raise the oxygen by 1%. Greenery tiles must be placed adjacent to any tile on the board the player already has ownership of. If there are none the greenery tile can be placed anywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Oceans are placed generally from cards (or from a standard action) and must be placed on a designated 'blue' tile. Placing any tile also gives any printed reward underneath it, such as plant, steel, or cards. Players do not claim ownership of oceans, but placing one does raise the global parameter for oceans by one, and there are nine ocean tiles in total that must be played. Any tile subsequently placed next to an ocean tile gives the player placing the new tile a two-credit bonus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Remember - increasing any of the three global parameters (including oceans) also results in a TR increase which provides both money production and VP at the end of the game. Once any of these global parameters are maxed, there is no longer any TR reward if they happen to be increased again through a card action: that part of the effect is essentially ignored.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558291955/pic2891962.jpg\" alt=\"the Terraforming Mars board\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The Terraforming Mars board.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>At the end of the round production occurs, and then each player receives four new cards. In the base version of the game, players choose which of these cards they want to add to their hand for 3 credits each. There is a draft variant where players still start with four cards, but then draft them around the table alternating passing left or right round to round.</p>\r\n<p>Once all three global parameters are filled, players complete that final round. VP are awarded based on TR rating, awards and milestones, VP on any cards that have been played, and tiles placed on the board. Greenery tiles are worth 1 VP for each of their owners, and city tiles are worth 1 VP for each adjacent greenery tile (regardless of owner) that they have. The player with the most VPs wins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558291955/pic2802632.jpg\" alt=\"A game of Terraforming Mars at it's end.\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">A game of Terraforming Mars at its end.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h3>Opinion</h3>\r\n<p>I've played Terraforming Mars the board game five times now with 3 - 5 players. It's fantastic. The game scales extremely well and because it ends not after a set number of rounds but when the global parameters are all reached, it seems to roughly take the same amount of time (two to two and a half hours). Each game has been very different: in some, the planet tiles have filled up quickly, in others very little development until the end. I've had all three of the different global parameters max out early depending on the play, so in one game oxygen maxed very early, in another, it might be oceans, and another heat. Conversely, the final parameter to get maxed can vary just as easily.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I love the theme of this game. Clearly the designers \"know their Mars\", and it's almost quasi-educational learning even from the rulebook on why the global parameter targets are set to what they are set. Short version: these really are the minimum targets humanity would need to make Mars livable. Everything ties together nicely, and the hundreds of unique cards also seem grounded in reality for things that would occur over the hundreds of years needed to terraform the planet.</p>\r\n<p>Player's strategies obviously change depending on the cards they get. After you play one beginner game, in my opinion, card drafting is essential. It makes going for a particular strategy much more feasible. In the standard game, you only draw four cards each round and it is very possible not to get any of a certain type of card, or only to get a broad spread of everything and not have any good combos appear. Drafting effectively mitigates this.</p>\r\n<p>There are a good number of cards that affect other players, but not enough that it feels like a player can be ruined by 'take that' cards. Most cards in the base version that affect other players cause them to lose plant resources, so players learn to spend these quickly as soon as they have eight accumulated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The engine building in this game is stellar. There is a very satisfying sense of progression in going from scraping together enough to play one or two cards per round, to being able to easily play multiple high-cost cards later in the game as you leverage your steel and titanium production in addition to your increased money generation. The global parameters tend to be stagnant or creep up very slowly in the first hour of gameplay, but towards the end, they can rocket up quickly resulting in races to boost them and get the associated TR bonus before they are maxed out.</p>\r\n<p>There is a separate set of advanced cards that I used for the first time yesterday. These definitely add to the game length, I went from an average of 2-2.5 hours to around 3.5 yesterday and all three of us had played before. These cards also offer a much broader variety of 'take that' (although still not overwhelming or too punishing). The game also takes longer because when using them, each player starts with a production of '0' for each resource rather than '1' in the base game.</p>\r\n<p>The components are overall very good. The board is excellent and looks visually appealing given how dry it could have been. The shiny resource cubes, while nice, have started to chip on the corners, especially the bronze ones. My big complaint though from a component perspective is the player mats. They're very flimsy, and also glossy so the cubes move all over the place on a slight bump. This is an issue especially given how easy you can lose track of your resource production. Thicker mats with a linen finish would have been more appropriate here, especially given the MSRP of the game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Minor quibbles on the mats aside, Terraforming Mars board game is an absolute winner. It's got an awesome theme that works, huge replayability, satisfying engine building, and juicy choices throughout the game. Highly recommended.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rating: 10/10</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Terraforming Mars review by guest-star&nbsp;Callan Bond</strong><strong>&nbsp;(calbond&nbsp;@ BGG), thanks a lot!</strong><br /> By the way, you should <a title=\"Recommended Terraforming Mars sleeves\" href=\"https://boardgame-news.com/top/terraforming-mars-sleeves\">sleeve your Terraforming Mars cards</a>.</p>"},"image":{"public_id":"wzcqfkluiwn6alqjbefy","version":{"$numberInt":"1558292060"},"signature":"f56996c3f13eb75f899e988eeaa060b91e514a19","width":{"$numberInt":"246"},"height":{"$numberInt":"246"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558292060/wzcqfkluiwn6alqjbefy.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558292060/wzcqfkluiwn6alqjbefy.jpg"},"metadescription":"A huge variety of cards and a myriad of ways to chain them into powerful engines is the heart of Terraforming Mars, and this is what makes it into such an enjoyable game with high replay value.","metatitle":"Terraforming Mars board game review","publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1558216800000"}},"author":{"$oid":"5ce1aa379fe50a72bf2b659d"},"salelinks":["http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575546705&toolid=10001&campid=5338611367&customid=&icep_uq=terraforming+mars&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=233&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg","https://amzn.to/2P5FQ94","https://www.gamenerdz.com/terraforming-mars?aff=34"],"saletext":"Pick Terraforming Mars the board game up at your favorite online retailer, it should cost around 45 dollars / 40 euros.","designer":"Jacob Fryxelius","playercount":"1-4, more with expansions","playtime":"90 - 120 min","publisher":"Stronghold Games","age":""},

All of the Heroes has at least ONE transformed card. A cool new mechanic, but adds some fiddliness to set up and storage.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Transform (Masterminds)</strong> - <em>Flip this Mastermind over</em>. Very cool, can generate some unexpected results. :)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Outwit</strong> - <em>Reveal 3 cards with a different cost in order to trigger the Outwit ability</em>. Promotes diversity in cost. Nothing fancy, but a new mechanic nevertheless.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wounded Fury</strong> - T<em>his card gains +1 attack for each wound in your discard pile</em>. This is awesome! A perfect mechanic for Hulk decks.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cross-Dimensional X Rampage</strong>&nbsp;- <em>All players reveal a X hero, or gain a wound</em>. This mechanic returns from Secret Wars, unclear why as it is pretty lame.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Feast</strong> - <em>KO the tops card of your deck</em>. This one returns from Paint the Town Red, and it's a very nasty mechanic mostly used by Masterminds. But in this set you can Feast with some of your Heroes. :)</li>\r\n<li>We will also see the return of <strong>Traps</strong>&nbsp;These are essentially a challenge you will have to overcome before the turn ends, or suffer the consequences!

Raaawr!</li>\r\n<li><em>Hiroim</em>&nbsp;- This guy can KO wounds etc, and rescue Bystanders. A lot of cards make him <strong>Transform</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><em>Hulkbuster Iron Man</em>&nbsp;- Designed by Mr Stark to battle the invading Hulk. Has <strong>Smash</strong> and <strong>Transform</strong>, a cool Hero.</li>\r\n<li><em>Joe Fix-It, Grey Hulk</em>&nbsp;- A wise-guy version of Hulk, perhaps more of a villain than a hero? Has cards that interact with villains and the Mastermind. Interesting stuff.</li>\r\n<li><em>Korg</em>&nbsp;- Korg does some serious <strong>Smashing</strong> and <strong>Outwitting</strong>.

A friend of King Hulk.</li>\r\n<li><em>Namora</em>&nbsp;- Not really a part of the storylines in this set, nevertheless she <strong>Smashes</strong> a lot. She also interacts with the city. Kind of like Storm from the main set, with <strong>Smash</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><em>No-Name, Brood Queen</em>&nbsp;- Also <strong>Feasts</strong>. Very nasty looking.

All these actions will get you points, the player with most points when the race card pile is depleted is the winner.</p>\r\n<h3>Setup</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Separate the Coins by value, and place them within reach of all players.</li>\r\n<li>Put the Racecards&nbsp;facedown in numerical order with&nbsp;Race 1 on top. Place the pile on the designated spot on the board.</li>\r\n<li>Place the Title Deed Cards&nbsp;in a pile next to the board.</li>\r\n<li>Each player chooses a character to race with. In the standard edition, you have Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad to chose between.</li>\r\n<li>Each player&nbsp;takes a reminder card and 10 money. That's it! We are ready to go.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Gameplay / rules</h3>\r\n<p>The gameplay is very straight-forward;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On your turn, you will roll the two dice, and decide which die to use first. Either you move first, or use the ability on the Power-Up die first.</li>\r\n<li>When you move, you will pick up all the coins on the spaces you pass, and all the coins on the space you land on.</li>\r\n<li>Depending on which space you land on, you will do different things.</li>\r\n<li>If you land or pass the GO space, you will trigger a race.</li>\r\n<li>After this, your turn ends and the next player to your left will have a go.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>The Power-Up die.</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Blue shell</strong>: Choose a player to drop 3 coins on his/her current space. When playing <strong>Peach</strong>, you may choose TWO other players do drop 3 coins.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Green shell</strong>: The player on the space closest, and in front of you to you drops 3 coin. If two players are in the same space, you choose who to hit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Flash</strong>: Every other player drops 1 coin at their current space. If you have <strong>Toad</strong>, each player also has to give you one of their coins.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3 coins</strong>: Get 3 coins from the bank. If you're <strong>Mario</strong>, you can choose to&nbsp;add 3 to your movement die roll instead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Banana</strong>: Drop a banana token on your current space. The next player who passes this space must stop and resolve that space's action. If you are playing <strong>Luigi</strong>, you can put a banana on any of the property spaces you own.</p>\r\n<h4>Spaces</h4>\r\n<h5>Thwomp</h5>\r\n<p>When you land here, drop 2 coins on the space.</p>\r\n<h5>Question mark</h5>\r\n<p>When you land here, roll the numbered die, and collect that many Coins from the Bank.</p>\r\n<h5>Tripple arrows</h5>\r\n<p>Roll your movement die again, and move that many spaces.</p>\r\n<h5>Star</h5>\r\n<p>Activate your character's special star ability.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Mario</strong>: Collect 3 coins and roll your movement die again.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Peach</strong>: Roll the Power-Up die again and complete the action.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Toad</strong>: You may drop up 5 coins and move forward that many spaces. Resolve the rules on the space where you land.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Luigi</strong>: You may move to the least expensive unowned property and buy it or put it out for auction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Properties</h5>\r\n<p>Properties are set up on the board from least expensive to most expensive. When you land on a property and it is unowned, you may buy it for the price printed on the space, if you buy it, take the deed card. This deed card will earn you money when someone else lands on the card, and it's also worth points at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<h6>Don't want to buy it or can't afford it?</h6>\r\n<p>The property goes up for auction. Bidding starts with you and moves to the left. Bids start at 1 Coin and may be raised by as little as 1 Coin.<br />The highest bidder wins the auction, and payment goes to the Bank. If all players pass on bidding, the property remains unowned.</p>\r\n<h6>Owned properties</h6>\r\n<p>When you land on a property that someone else owns, pay them the rent shown on the property's Title Deed card.</p>\r\n<p>If a player owns both properties in a color set, pay them double rent. If the owner doesn't ask you to pay rent before the next player rolls the dice, you don't have to pay, so pay attention! :)</p>\r\n<h6>Property Deals</h6>\r\n<p>At any time on your turn, you may offer to buy, sell, or trade Property with other players. You may not sell nor trade Boss cards at any time. The points you earn from beating a Boss are yours until the end of the game!</p>\r\n<h5>Just visiting</h5>\r\n<p>You may pick up any coins dropped here, apart from that this space does nothing.</p>\r\n<h5>Go to Jail</h5>\r\n<p>Move your Character Token to the In Jail space immediately! Do not collect 2 Coins for passing GO, and do not collect any Coins you pass or land on. Do not flip over a Boss card. Your turn is over.</p>\r\n<h6>While In Jail</h6>\r\n<p>You may not take part in Boss Fights while In Jail.</p>\r\n<p>You may still collect rent, take part in auctions, and trade. Character Abilities still affect you. If you ever need to drop Coins while In Jail, drop them on the Just Visiting space.</p>\r\n<h6>How do I get out of Jail?</h6>\r\n<p>Either Pay 5 Coins to the Bank before you roll the dice for your turn. Then roll both dice, and take your turn as normal. Or<br /> Roll the numbered die. If you get a 6, get out of Jail for free! Roll both dice, and take your turn as normal. If you fail to roll a 6, your turn ends. After your second attempt at rolling, you may exit Jail for free and roll both dice normally on your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>When you leave Jail, you may pick up any Coins on Just Visiting.</p>\r\n<h5>GO</h5>\r\n<p>When you pass or land on GO, you will collect 2 coins from the bank, and also a <strong>RACE</strong> will happen. You will draw the top card of the race, and everyone who wants to participate in the race must pay its cost. The winner gets the card (worth the points printed on it), and also gets to resolve the action printed on the card for the winner. Some cards also have effects happening the players ending up on 2:nd and 3:rd place.<br /><strong>When the last race is finished, the game ends!</strong></p>\r\n<p>When the game has ended, players add up their points from their Properties, Races, and Coins. Every 5 coins if worth 10 points. So for example,&nbsp;if you have 23 coins, they&nbsp;are worth 40 points.<br />If there is a tie, the player with the most amount of property and racecards win!<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h3>Opinion</h3>\r\n<h5>The good</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fast-paced, easily doable in 30 minutes if everyone knows how to play.</li>\r\n<li>Good option if playing with kids, as there is a lot of randomnesses.</li>\r\n<li>The Mario Kart theme well implemented, shooting shells, etc. at each other is fun.</li>\r\n<li>Not very Monopoly-like.</li>\r\n<li>The rule sheet/rulebook is well laid out.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>There are monopoly gamer Mario kart power packs to expand the game with more characters, if you wish.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>The bad</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>VERY random, not for gamers, better suited for families preferrable with kids.</li>\r\n<li>The quality of the cards are so-so.</li>\r\n<li>If you are a Monopoly fan, you will be disappointed as the properties part of the game is very light. Also, you can't buy hotels, etc.</li>\r\n<li>English rulebook pdf is hard to find.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\r\n<p>An OK game for kids and families. <strong>Great</strong> if you also like Mario Kart. Actual gamers; stay away from this one, it's too random. <strong>6/10</strong>. That said, this might be the best Mario board game out there, and one of the best Monopoly Gamer versions.</p>\r\n<p>Do you have any questions about the rules or about the game in general?

For example&nbsp; in a 4-player game, you will use the 3-player board from the base game and the a Sky Island board. The Sky Island board is double sided, one with 3 islands and one with 2, and you are free to choose which one you want to play.<br />The Sky Islands are accessed from the base board by the Beanstalk or the Stairway, the location of these are randomized, but it's recomended that you keep them apart, and keep them away from the border zones.</p>\r\n<p>Also, In 4- and 5-player games, put the &ldquo;END&rdquo; token on the last spot of the Game Turn track to remind you that the game lasts one turn less due to the change of board. In 3- and 6-player games, you play to the end of the turn track for that board.<br />That's it. You're ready to play.</p>\r\n<h3>Rules</h3>\r\n<p>The Sky Island zones work just like normal zones, but you cannot access the sky island in other means than through&nbsp;the Beanstalk or the Stairway (unless you can fly..). You also cannot start there unless you have a special power that says so. <strong>If you hold all the zones in on Sky Island at the end of your turn, you will get one extra coin</strong>. So there's the incentive to go there in the firt place.</p>\r\n<h4>New Races</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Drakons</strong>: Each turn,transform 0-3 Race tokens into Dragons. These work in the same way as the Dragon from the base game. They are removed next turn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scavengers</strong>: When Scavengers conquer an In decline region, race tokens that would normally be discarded stay in place and add to the region&rsquo;s defense.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Khans</strong>: Khans earn an extra coin per hill or farmland. However, other regions are worth one less coin.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wendigos</strong>: Once per turn, choose any forest: remove all race tokens here and give an extra Race token to the Wendigos.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Escargots</strong>: Receive coins for occupied tegions at the beginning turn, not at the end. Coins from Special Power work like normal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scarecrows</strong>: When a player conquers an active Scarecrow region, that player earns an extra coin from the bank.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Storm Giants</strong>: Can start in the Sky Islands. Get two Lightning Bolt tokens; with them conquer any mountain region by using a single race token.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>New Special Powers</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Airborne</strong>: During the turn when the Airborne power is selected, conquests follow normal requirements but they cost two less Race tokens than normal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Exploring</strong>: At the end of each of your turns, you receive a Victory coin bonus equal to the number of Regions you occupy on the Ground or in the Sky Islands, whichever is less.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Goldsmith</strong>: The Goldsmith Race earns 2 more coins per Mine Region. Any other Region is worth&nbsp;one coin less (But not less than 0).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Gunner</strong>: You get two cannons. With these you can conquer adjacent regions for 2 less. They&nbsp;enter the game \"inactive\" and must be flipped to the \"Fire\" side before they can be used. When they are inactive they can be moved to other regions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Haggling</strong>: You receive 5 Trade Pact tokens, which you can give to other players. If players with these pact tokens attacks any of your regions, he or she must pay you the ammount of coins equal to the number of Pact tokens he has. On the other hand, you must pay him if he does NOT attack you.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Racketeering</strong>: When another player chooses a new race, you earn as many VC as the number of skips they make. On decline, your next race is free.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Zeppelined</strong>: You will have access to 5 zeppelin tokens which you can use to conquer any region of the map. You must roll the reinforcement die, aand apply it as it was a final conquest. But if you roll 0 the zeppeline crashed and the defender must remove 1 token, and get the rest back in hand. The attacker must also remove a token and the zone is set on fire. This zone is immune to conquests and specials abilities until next round.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>That's pretty much it when it comes to rules and game play. The small world: Sky Islands rulebook can be found <a title=\"Small World Sky Islands rulebook\" href=\"https://cdn0.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/img/sw_si_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>OPINION</h3>\r\n<h4>The good</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Sky islands are a small, but cool adition to the game. Makes the game even tighter and more competative.</li>\r\n<li>7 new races and 7 new Special Powers are generous compared to some other expansions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>The bad?</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nothing bad to say really.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n<p>This expansion is probably the best one up to date. 7 new races and 7 new special powers, most of them interesting. The Sky Islands and their accesspoints will be fiercely competed for, which is what this game is all about. But in the same time, another player might focus to dominate the base board instead.... Again, probably the best small world expansion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Great stuff, 8/10.</strong></p>"},"designer":"T.

In this review, I will mainly be discussing the standard rules.</p>\r\n<p>To begin the standard game, you will set aside the four league, four workshop, three workshop upgrades, and four turn sequence cards. These will not be used during this game. The remaining cards are shuffled together and then placed face down in the center of the play area. Players will take ten resource tokens and place them in front of themself. This is their resource pool. The first player is chosen and gameplay now begins.</p>\r\n<p>The game consists of a lot of bidding. To start the game, the first player flips over the top card and bids on it using the tokens in their resource pool. The bidding then continues around the table with players either bidding higher or passing. Once a player passes they can not bid again on that particular card. If all players pass and no one bids on a card, it is discarded and a new card is drawn. The player that bids the highest bid wins the card and places it in front of them. They must then place the number of tokens that they bid on the card. This signifies that the card is in Development. All players are then able to remove a token from any cards in Development that have tokens on them. Those tokens are returned to the player&rsquo;s resource pool. Once the last token on a card in Development is removed, it is complete and ready to be used. The same is done with any events that are in Development. Once this is completed, the bidding round is over. The player that won the card becomes the first player and flips over the next card of the deck, beginning a new round of bidding.</p>\r\n<p>Players must have one capsule, one propulsion, and one steering component to make a rocket. They may also add up to three accessories of their choice. These accessories can help the players' chance of succeeding when trying to launch their rocket. A player can not launch a rocket until all of their components are no longer in Development.</p>\r\n<p>To launch a rocket and thus win the game, a player has to announce that they are ready to launch at the end of a bidding round. The player must set aside the components that they plan to use so that the other players know which pieces are being used and to be able to add up the reliability scores to get a total. The player then rolls two dice and adds them together. If they roll equal to or lower, they have succeeded and are the winner. If they roll higher, they must take the pieces that they used and shuffle them together. The player to their left chooses one of the cards at random and discard it. That piece suffered a catastrophic failure and is destroyed. A roll of 12 is always a failure and a roll of 2 is always a success. If more than one player launches a rocket at the same time, the player that rolls lowest for a successful launch by rolling equal to or lower than their reliability rating wins.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"The game components\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1585229510/pic2949850.jpg\" alt=\"The game components\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-right\">The artwork looks very nice.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The advanced games play a lot like the standard game except with a few variations. The main difference is that cards must be bought much like in a deck builder. There is no bidding. Players can either launch, perform scientific research to raise their level in a certain area of research or acquire events to sabotage their opponents. Components can then be added to form the rocket. Just like the standard game, the first player to successfully launch their rocket and land on the Moon wins.</p>\r\n<h3>OPINION</h3>\r\n<h4>COMPONENTS</h4>\r\n<p>This game looks nice. To start with it comes inside a sleeved wooden box. The cards all have a very steampunk feel to them and they look and feel really nice. They are a good thickness and shuffle really well. I really like the artwork. The card design isn&rsquo;t bad either. All the information is easily distinguished so that you can find what you&rsquo;re looking for rather easily on them. The dice are really nice as well. The counters are thin plastic and come with a sheet of stickers that must be placed on them. The stickers are little gears or cogs. I&rsquo;m not usually a big fan of sticking stickers on stuff. I&rsquo;d really have preferred the counters to be thick cardboard with the image printed on them or even some form of die-cut counter that looked like a gear. All in all, it isn&rsquo;t bad but it could have been done a little better.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8/10</strong></p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"The game components\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1585229511/b847c58f8667d1bdddebe43e7e8d83f4_large.jpg\" alt=\"The game components\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-right\">The game components.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>RULEBOOK</h4>\r\n<p>The rulebook is small and fits nicely inside the box. It&rsquo;s completely done in black and white. Everything is laid out rather well with regards to both the standard and advanced rules. There&rsquo;s a nice picture on how to set up the advanced game. The last few pages show examples of the different types of cards. Other than that, there really are no pictures to speak of. There is one example that explains a little about the scientific research but that&rsquo;s it. The rules are easy to read and understand. As good as it is, I really would have preferred there to be more pictures and examples. I especially would have preferred color to the book. The saving grace for this is that it is set up so well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7/10</strong></p>\r\n<h4>GAMEPLAY</h4>\r\n<p>The game is quite fun. I enjoy both the standard and advanced rules. The betting mechanic in the standard version is lots of fun. This version captures the feel of an actual race. It&rsquo;s neat to only be needing one more piece to send your rocket into space just to lose it in a bidding war. It&rsquo;s frustrating and fun at the same time. I really enjoy the interaction between players. The other version feels a bit more like a deck builder to me. Granted, you&rsquo;re not building your deck but buying events to sabotage your opponents and buying pieces to add to your ship through research. It&rsquo;s really fun as a 2 player game much like some of my favorite deck builders. Both versions are fun and I think most players will be able to find at least one version of the game that they will like.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9/10</strong></p>\r\n<h4>OVERALL</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Leagues of Adventure: Rocket Race</strong> is a light card game of rocket building fun. The game at it&rsquo;s longest playtime is around 30 minutes. That&rsquo;s for the advanced version. The standard is a little bit less. It&rsquo;s fairly simple to learn and play. It&rsquo;s one that almost any player will be able to find a version that they enjoy. I feel that deck-building fans, as well as bidding game players, will enjoy this. The artwork is really nice on the cards and has a definite steampunk feel to them. I wish that the counters had been designed better and that the rules had more content and were in color. The game lives up to it&rsquo;s name as it definitely feels like a race. Even with the few problems, the gameplay is solid. I really enjoyed playing it. I recommend that you give it a try. You might just enjoy it as much as we did.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8/10</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>This review of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Leagues of Adventure: Rocket Race was written by guest-star Jonathan Nelson.

They will score points from the cards that they collect. The player that is best able to score the right combinations and collect the most points will be declared the winner.</p>\r\n<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>\r\n<p>To begin, all the cards are shuffled together. The number of players will determine how many cards each player will be dealt, from 10 cards in a 2 player game to 7 cards in a 5 player one. The rest of the cards are then placed face down in the center of the play area. You&rsquo;ll need to get a pen and paper to keep score. Play can now begin.</p>\r\n<p>The game is played over 3 rounds. At the beginning of each round, the players will simultaneously choose 1 of the cards from their hand and place it face down in front of them. Once all players have done this, everyone reveals the card that they chose. The remaining cards in a player&rsquo;s hand are then passed to the player on their left. Player&rsquo;s take the new cards that they were just handed and repeat the previous process, choosing a card and placing it face down in front of them. This will continue until the final card is passed and placed. This is the basics of the game, of course, the cards that you play will determine your score at the end of the round and the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>Each type of card score points in a different way. Maki rolls score for having the most maki roll icons. Tempura scores for sets of 2 and nothing for single cards. Sashimi only scores for sets of 3. Dumplings score points for each card played. The more of them you have the more points you will score. The nagiri cards are a bit different. Each of these will score a set amount, however, if they are on top of a wasabi card, they score higher points. Wasabi by itself scores nothing. Chopstick cards score nothing as well, but if you play them during the game, you can take 2 sushi cards on a future turn. To do this, you must have a chopstick card already out in front of you and can only play 1 of these per turn. Then when you reveal a card, you can yell &ldquo;Sushi Go!&rdquo; and take another card from your hand and place it. The chopstick card will then go into your hand and be passed on that turn.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have scored your cards, you will announce your score for the scorekeeper to write down. All the played cards will be discarded except for pudding cards. New cards will be dealt to each player and the next round will continue just like before. Once the third round has been scored, the pudding cards are scored. The player with the most puddings gains points while the one with the least loses points. Once the pudding totals have been added by the scorekeeper, the point totals for all three rounds are added up. The player with the most points is the winner.</p>\r\n<h3>OPINION</h3>\r\n<h4>COMPONENTS</h4>\r\n<p>This game&rsquo;s only components are a deck of cards that come inside a really nice embossed tin. The tin is very cute and holds everything really well. The cards are very cute and sturdy. The artwork is really great and has a really fun design to them. I&rsquo;m really a fan of the art and like how adorable it is. The cards are easy to shuffle and seem thick enough and sturdy enough for repeated gameplay. The only thing that&rsquo;s missing is a better way of keeping score than using a pen and paper. I know that originally the game came with scoring cards that made it possible to keep track of your score without writing it down. I&rsquo;m not sure how well that works as I haven&rsquo;t tried it but I think it&rsquo;s a neat idea. In any case, the game&rsquo;s components are still great.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9/10</strong></p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"The game components\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1586252341/pic1950458_md.jpg\" alt=\"The game components\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Sturdy cards. Good stuff.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>RULEBOOK</h4>\r\n<p>The rule book is a really neat artistic design. It&rsquo;s in full color and has lots of pictures and explanations throughout. The cute artwork and designs permeate every page. There are several different variants including rules for 2 players. On the back is a quick game summary that includes how each card scores points. It&rsquo;s really helpful and provides lots of information. It&rsquo;s not very big but it packs a lot inside. Everything is really easy to read and understand. There&rsquo;s nothing difficult here at all.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10/10</strong></p>\r\n<h4>GAMEPLAY</h4>\r\n<p>This game is a lot of fun. I really enjoy the card drafting mechanic in games like 7 Wonders and Fairy Tale. This game is no different. It&rsquo;s well crafted and plays off the mechanic superbly well. This is something that the kids really seem to enjoy. The cute artwork is something that the girls will especially like. There&rsquo;s plenty of player interaction just like in any good card drafting game. It&rsquo;s really easy to learn and play. It doesn&rsquo;t take much time to play either. Most games are usually done in less than 15 minutes. It&rsquo;s small enough that it can be taken and played almost anywhere. It&rsquo;s great fun and is very competitive. I really enjoy it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10/10</strong></p>\r\n<h4>OVERALL</h4>\r\n<p>Sushi Go is a light game of card drafting with a Sushi restaurant theme. It&rsquo;s something that everyone can and will enjoy. Kids and adults both will enjoy playing it. It&rsquo;s simple enough that everyone can learn. I love the card drafting mechanic and this one does it really well. It&rsquo;s played in less than 15 minutes, so you won&rsquo;t be spending a lot of time playing it. It&rsquo;s a great filler or lightweight game for novice players. I highly recommend this game. It&rsquo;s something that fans of 7 Wonders and Fairy Tale will definitely enjoy. The artwork is really cute and it might just get your girlfriend or wive interested enough to play it with you. Any game that does that gets a high score from me. With a low price point, it&rsquo;s something that is affordable as well as fun to play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10/10</strong></p>\r\n<p>This review of Sushi Go!&nbsp;was written by guest-star Jonathan Nelson.

The last person standing is the winner! To achieve this, you will claim locations, shoot the other players, and avoid getting trapped in the Storm!</p>\r\n<h3>Setup</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Place the board on a surface where everyone can reach it.</li>\r\n<li>Place the Health Point (HP)&nbsp;tokens within reach of all players. This is the HP pile.</li>\r\n<li>Shuffle the Loot chest and Storm cards, and place them facedown on their respective place on the board.</li>\r\n<li>Place the location cards next to their matching board spaces outside the board.</li>\r\n<li>Each player starts the game with 15 HP tokens. Note that under no circumstances can you have more than 15 HP, and when you run out of them, your character is dead and you are out of the game.</li>\r\n<li>Each player chooses a character, then rolls the numbered die. The highest roller has the first choice of where they'll start the game and places their character in that space. Character placement moves to the left. On your first turn, do not perform the action of your starting space.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That's it! You are ready to go.</p>\r\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\r\n<p>Here follows the rules and the gameplay, which are straightforward. On your turn you will;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Roll both dice, move your character the number of spaces on your normal die, then perform the action on the Action die.</li>\r\n<li>At the end of your turn, if you landed on or passed GO, flip over the top Storm card. The card will tell you which board space you must permanently cover with the deadly Storm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You may also trade locations and loot chests with other players at any time of your turn.</p>\r\n<h4>Board Spaces</h4>\r\n<h5>Locations</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When you land on a location, and no other player has claimed it, you may claim it (take it) for yourself. You don't pay anything, just take the card.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>If you have claimed both locations of a given color, you get 2 HP each time you land on any of these. Remember, <strong>you cannot get more than 15 HP, ever</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>If you land on another player's location, you must get rid of the number of HP shown on the board. The HP tokens go back to the HP pile.</li>\r\n<li>If&nbsp;you land on a location taken by the Storm, you must pay&nbsp;the number of HP shown on the card to the HP pile.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Go</h5>\r\n<p>Whenever you pass go, collect 2 HP from the pile and flip over the top Storm card at the end of your turn.</p>\r\n<h5>Free Parking</h5>\r\n<p>Nothing happens in this space. A good place to shoot people from, though.</p>\r\n<h5>Campfire</h5>\r\n<p>Gain&nbsp;1 HP from the pile.</p>\r\n<h5>Spike Trap</h5>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Pay 1 HP to the pile.</p>\r\n<h5>Loot Chest</h5>\r\n<p>When you land here, draw a Loot chest card. There are two kinds, one that you will keep for the rest of the game, and one type that is one-time use. You may use these at your turn during the game, and you may also use multiple cards to create powerful combinations. After you have used a one-time card, put it at the bottom of the Loot chest deck.</p>\r\n<h5>Just Visiting</h5>\r\n<p>Move your character to the Just Visiting space of the Jail.</p>\r\n<h5>Go to Jail</h5>\r\n<p>If you land on Go to Jail, you must do the following;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Move your character to Jail, without passing GO.&nbsp;If the Storm has taken the space, you lose 2 HP, but you are not in Jail. You can move normally on your next turn.</li>\r\n<li>Draw a Storm card, and put it o the corresponding space on the board, like normal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Your turn is now over./p&gt;</p>\r\n<h5>While you are in Jail</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Players may still attack you.</li>\r\n<li>If the Storm takes the Jail space while you are there, you do not lose 2 HP.</li>\r\n<li>You may pay 2HP to get out of Jail on your turn after that just roll the 2 dice and have a normal turn.</li>\r\n<li>Or, you may roll the numbered die, if you roll 6 you get out of Jail for free, and if not, your turn is over.</li>\r\n<li>If you're on the Jail space when the Storm takes it, you get out of Jail for free! Move normally on your next turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>The Action Die</h4>\r\n<p>The action die has 4 different symbols on it, all which let's you do the corresponding action:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bandage - Gain 2 HP.</li>\r\n<li>Crosshairs - You may now shoot any player in your line of sight, as in, if they are on the same side of the board as you. If you are in a corner you may target players on 2 sides. The target pays 1 HP to the pile. Some loot cards let you modify this action, so be on the lookout!</li>\r\n<li>Brick - When you roll a brick, move, and complete the action of that space. Then place a <strong>wall</strong>, standing up, on any space in your path. When another player reaches a wall, that player must stop there and perform the action on that space. After that, the wall is removed. Players may also target the wall by shooting it like they would a player to get rid of the wall before moving.</li>\r\n<li>Boogie Bomb -&nbsp;When you roll this bad boy, all other players lose 1 HP to the Bank, and all walls are destroyed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Storm Cards</h4>\r\n<p>At the end of a turn when you landed or passed GO, or have gone to Jail, you must draw a Storm Card.&nbsp;The card will tell you which space is being taken by the Storm, it can be&nbsp;on a certain board space, or, if a location is being taken by the Storm, the card will ask you to place that space's location card Storm-side up on that space.</p>\r\n<p>When you land on a location taken by the Storm, you must pay the number of HP shown on the card to the Bank. When you land on any other board space taken by the Storm, you must pay 2 HP to the Bank.</p>\r\n<p>Do not carry out the action of a space if the Storm has taken it.</p>\r\n<p>Once Storm cards have been placed, they can't be moved. If the Storm takes a space while you're on it, you do not lose 2 HP.</p>\r\n<h4>Running out of HP</h4>\r\n<p>You're out of the game! Take your character of the board, any Loot chest items your had is dropped on the spot your character died. The next person landing on that spot picks them up!&nbsp;<br />Any location cards you might have had are placed on their matching spaces with the <strong>Storm side up</strong>.</p>\r\n<h4>End of the Game</h4>\r\n<p>The game ends when there is one player left standing.</p>\r\n<h3>Opinion</h3>\r\n<h5>The good</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fast-paced, and action-filled.</li>\r\n<li>Fun to play with Fortnite-fans.</li>\r\n<li>Not anything like normal Monopoly.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The Fortnite theme is well implemented.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>The bad</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The quality of the components is so-so, but the game is cheap so no surprise there.</li>\r\n<li>If you are a Monopoly fan, you will be disappointed as the properties part of the game is very light. Also, you can't buy hotels, etc.</li>\r\n<li>English rulebook pdf is&nbsp;impossible to find.

We got you. Check this puzzle out, it's one of our definitive favorites.</p>\r\n<p>The german <strong>Schmidt Spiele</strong> has been producing quality puzzles for a long time, so when we dived into this one we had great expectations. To our satisfaction, the quality of the box and the pieces were top-notch, very much like a Ravensburger puzzle.</p>\r\n<p>The layout of the puzzle is a beautiful house in four different seasons, and there is a lot going on. The family just had a small baby, and the crib is being prepared on one of the pictures for an example. Overall,&nbsp;the level of detail is just fantastic, and it really seems like the motive was made for being a puzzle, and at the same time tells you a story. There is something interesting happening in every part of the puzzle.</p>\r\n<p>The motive is drawn by veteran <a title=\"Steve Crisps website\" href=\"http://www.crispart.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Crisp</a>, and like it's maker is very crisp indeed.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1589130813/IMG_3433.jpg\" alt=\"Details\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Christmas.

Without spoiling anything the answer is yes, and no. :)</p>\r\n<h3>Opinion</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Board: Very good.</li>\r\n<li>Cutting: Very good.</li>\r\n<li>Image: Excellent.</li>\r\n<li>Box:&nbsp;Very good.</li>\r\n<li>Fit: Excellent.</li>\r\n<li>Puzzle Dust:&nbsp;Quite a bit.

Well, this is one of the best 2000 piece puzzles we ever had the pleasure of laying and even though 2000 pieces might be overwhelming to many people we believe that this puzzle can be conquered by anyone, thanks to varied sections and very little single color spaces. A fantastic puzzle for families and veterans alike.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A real gem;&nbsp;10/10</strong></p>"},"designer":"Steve Crisp","image":{"public_id":"ec9p0rxuclbubtkhp2vl","version":{"$numberInt":"1589135779"},"signature":"4c7decac150414c243814dc708b09721daf9e50d","width":{"$numberInt":"1500"},"height":{"$numberInt":"1069"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1589135779/ec9p0rxuclbubtkhp2vl.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1589135779/ec9p0rxuclbubtkhp2vl.jpg"},"metadescription":"A review of the 2000 pieces puzzle Jahreszeiten Haus (Four season house) by Schmidt Spiele","metatitle":"Schmidt puzzle: Four seasons  (2000 pieces)","playercount":"","playtime":"58345","publisher":"Schmidt Spiele","saletext":"This one should cost around 25-35 dollars/euros/pounds","author":{"$oid":"5bf88dbd1971ad70901b248f"},"publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1589061600000"}}},

There are 3 different kinds, red, blue, and greens. You can probably guess that these represent the workers, big business, and the progressives respectively.</p>\r\n<p>Then, players will be given 2 <strong>special interest cards</strong>,&nbsp;and you will be doing everything to please these groups to gain power (points). Of these two cards, players will choose one, so it's a good idea to chose one that goes hand-in-hand with the constituents cards you have been dealt. Finally, each player will be dealt 2 <strong>cabinet member cards</strong>, which special powers usable throughout the game. These cabinet members range from classic leaders figures like Nelson Mandela and Gandhi to more controversial ones like Khomeini and Stalin. Each player is also given 10 <strong>player cubes</strong> in a color of their choice, 2 <strong>yellow influence</strong> tokens, and 1 <strong>smear token</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Now that the player setup is done, you will sort the 30 different <strong>policies</strong> into rows, starting with the 6 headline policies, and after that, you will overlap that row with the 6 major and finally 18 minor policies. This is called the <strong>policy landscape</strong>.<br />Then, put the cabinet members and <strong>political crisis</strong> stacks face down close to the policies. The final part of the setup is to pick the right pair of <strong>deal-making dice</strong>; The white dice are for games with 3-4 players, and the black dice is for games with 5-6 players. That's it, setup should take you no more than 5 minutes.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1600153504/corridors.jpg\" alt=\"Corridors of Power Cabinet Members.\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The cabinet members in Corridors of Power comes from all kinds of eras in history. The artwork is excellent.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\r\n<p>When it's your turn, you will first decide which fellow player you want to make a deal with. Probably one you suspect has similar in-game interest as you. Then you will roll the two deal-making dice and take one for yourself and give the other one to the player you chose. Both players receive the resources indicated on the dice. This can be influence, smear, cabinet member cards, and the ability to move a policy from the the policy landscape to the policy wasteland, where it cannot be voted on. You can also use this to do the vice-versa.</p>\r\n<p>Then, you will enter the <strong>Policy proposal</strong> phase. You will pick a policy from the policy landscape that is not overlapped by another policy and every player must cast a vote by secretly contributing influence and/or smear. It is also possible not to contribute anything. At this point, you will discuss with your fellow players and trying to convince them to vote as you want them to, and players might make promises and break them, just like the dirty politician you are. All good fun.<br />When everyone is ready, they simultaneously reveal their votes, and if the influence is enough, the policy will pass. Note that <strong>smear</strong> will count as negative influence.</p>\r\n<p>Each policy has a policy cost, an influence threshold that must be satisfied in order for the policy to pass. These can range from 4 for the minor policies and 8 for the headline policies. If the policy does not pass, it goes to the policy wasteland, and if it passes, the player that contributed the most will&nbsp;place a cube on the 1st player score, and the player who contributed the second most will score the 2nd spot. There are usually 2 or 3 such spaces on each card.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1600154873/corridorpolicy.jpg\" alt=\"An Corridors of Power policy card.\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The structure of a Policy card.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Gameplay will continue in this fashion until 2 of the headline policies have been proposed, and then each player gets one more turn, after that the game ends.</p>\r\n<p>Game End and Scoring</p>\r\n<p>First, each player scores the points on the <strong>policy cards</strong> they contributed to like stated above, and then they will score the <strong>special interest cards</strong>. Typically, these cards reward you if certain policies have passed, and punishes you if certain other policies have passed.<br />After that, <strong>constituents are scored</strong>. To do this, count the number of passed policies of each color. The policy with the highest number is the winning color, followed by the color that has the 2nd highest number of policies passed. Players will now score 3 points per constituent card they have of the winning type and 1 point each for the runner-up. Note that these points may be boosted by passing certain policies.<br />Finally, players might have cabinet member cards that score points. The winner is surprisingly enough the player with the most Power (points).</p>\r\n<h3>OPINION</h3>\r\n<h4>The good</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A unique blend of social and strategy, a party game on the heavier side, if you will.</li>\r\n<li>Very tense.</li>\r\n<li>A lot of surprises and twists thanks to the combination of the voting system and cabinet members card.</li>\r\n<li>Very cut-throat.</li>\r\n<li>Very nice artwork and components.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>The bad</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A bit lengthy, it takes around 90 minutes to play.</li>\r\n<li>Very cut-throat. This can be remedied to some degree by simple variants though.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\r\n<p>Corridors of Power delivers what it promises; a&nbsp;social game with strategic depth. To win, you must truly be like a politician, make&nbsp;allies, and break deals at the right time, preferably playing the other players against each other while you sneak the policies you want pass voting, while you must control your resources in form of influence, smear, and cabinet member cards.</p>\r\n<p>If you can find a group of people who would enjoy a game like that this is perfect since there are very few games like this on the market. Be warned though, it is cut-throat which might be a good thing and a bad thing depending on the group of people you play with.</p>\r\n<p>To sum it up, a very interesting, fun, and merciless social game on the heavier side. <strong>7/10</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>I want to thank the Bailey Brother for sending me a copy to review.
