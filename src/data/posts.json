Then, starting with the round's first player, each player takes one action in clockwise order until all players have passed and the round ends. The actions are:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Use the power of one of your items in play.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Place a card from your hand into play after paying its cost.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Acquire a monument or place of power from the shared playing area after paying its cost.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Discard a card from your hand for any two non-gold resources or one gold.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Pass.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once you pass, you're out for the round. You straighten all your cards, draw one card from your deck, swap your current magic item for one in the reserve pool, and (if you're the first one to pass) claim the first player marker, which adds 1 victory point (VP) to your score while you hold it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So that's the overview of a round, but what you are actually doing? Racing for points, with the game ending the round that someone has at least 10 VPs, with whoever has the most VPs winning. Some of the cards in your deck will be worth VPs if you have them in play, but most of your points come from the monuments and places of power you acquire, with those latter cards often having a variable value depending on what you do with them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Check out the expansion, <a title=\"Res Arcana: Lux et Tenebrae\" href=\"http://www.boardgame-news.com/news/post/res-arcana-expansion-lux-et-tenebrae\">Lux et Tenebrae</a>.</p>","purehtml":""},"publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1542927600000"}},"image":{"public_id":"vpsmixeljdkqnjt3asoc","version":{"$numberInt":"1543280537"},"signature":"b44ac1107210144b0779e6a46a3498450c740601","width":{"$numberInt":"500"},"height":{"$numberInt":"500"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543280537/vpsmixeljdkqnjt3asoc.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543280537/vpsmixeljdkqnjt3asoc.jpg"},"amazonads":[],"files":[],"heroimg":"board1.jpg","metadescription":"","metakeywords":[],"metatitle":"","salelinks":["https://www.gamenerdz.com/res-arcana?aff=34","https://amzn.to/2Uud18A"],"saletext":"This game has been released back in 2019, pick it up below.

His enemies are numerous, and they&rsquo;ll stop at nothing to bring his empire to its knees.&nbsp;<br />He will have to avoid his would-be captors, as he moves from one Location to the next, using his many properties as hideouts in a high stakes game of cat and mouse.</p>\r\n<p>In&nbsp;Narcos: The Board Game, based on the Netflix original show, one player takes on the role of the Patr&oacute;n, while the others become the Factions forming a tense alliance in their search for the cartel kingpin. Unfortunately for the Patr&oacute;n, his Sicarios leave behind clues to his Location, allowing the Factions to close the net. Are the Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s days numbered, or will he find a way to escape his pursuers?</p>\r\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Narcos: The Board Game&nbsp;is a hidden movement and resource management game where one player takes on the role of El Patr&oacute;n, leader of the Colombian drug industry, trying to stealthily make their way around the country, sending out their Sicarios to do their dirty work, while the rest of the players form a coalition of Factions looking to hunt him down. The Factions have to work together, triangulating and coordinating their movements, sharing vital information, and attempting to capture Patr&oacute;n twice before he gains too much popularity and achieves victory by completing objectives or becoming El Presidente.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>The game board features a map of Colombia. Across the map is a network of locations, from the various cities in the country, to all the outlying farming settlements. Patr&oacute;n could potentially be hidden in any location, and it&rsquo;s up to the Factions players to figure out just where he is. This is done over a series of rounds, called Seasons. During a Season, the players will alternate turns, starting with Patr&oacute;n, then one of the Factions, then back to Patr&oacute;n again, then another of the Factions. That continues until all four Factions players have had a turn. Once a Faction player has taken a turn, they are done for that Season, but they can still help the other players by discussing the potential hiding places for Patr&oacute;n.</p>\r\n<p>On a turn, Patr&oacute;n will deploy one of their Sicarios. There are many different henchmen that work for Patr&oacute;n, but only a small number will work for him each game. Two that are always around are Le&oacute;n and La Quica, Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s most trusted employees. When Patr&oacute;n starts a turn, they will choose one Sicario to place on the board. Each one has a different special ability when placed, from smuggling drugs, to growing new crops, to assassinating enemies. When placed, there are limitations on where they can go. They can only be placed so many spaces away from Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s current hiding spot. This gives the Factions players a small clue as to where Patr&oacute;n currently is.</p>\r\n<p>Necessity can create strange bedfellows, and that&rsquo;s just what we have with the Factions. While it might be not surprising to see the American DEA working with the Policia Nacional De Colombia, the addition of the Cali Cartel and Los Pepes goes to show how desperate all these groups are to shut down Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s operations. Each Faction has two Hunters that they will move around the map and perform actions with during their turn. These include trying to capture Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s Sicarios, set up roadblocks to halt Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s movements, and gain clues as to Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s hiding spot. Each Faction also has its own special ability, such as the DEA&rsquo;s ability to increase the value of certain actions or move their Hunters around Colombia faster, or Los Pepes&rsquo; ability to gain money any time Patr&oacute;n does, using their own drug networks to increase their wealth, which can then be spent hunting Patr&oacute;n down.</p>\r\n<p>El Patr&oacute;n&rsquo;s location on the map is always hidden, being marked on a special tab sheet. Patr&oacute;n must make sure to always keep their location secret. When the Hunters close in, he&rsquo;s in danger of being captured. Thankfully, he&rsquo;s a sneaky snake and can be captured once and still continue on. However, if the Factions players close in and capture Patr&oacute;n twice, the game ends with their victory. Meanwhile, Patr&oacute;n is constantly gaining Glory in Colombia. Once he gains enough, he&rsquo;ll be elected Presidente and win.</p>\r\n<p>Narcos: The Board Game is a game of wits, deduction, cunning, and stealth. Will the Factions be able to close the net around the elusive Patr&oacute;n? Or will he once more slip away into the jungle underbrush, only to gain power with every passing Season?</p>\r\n<p>Narcos: The Board Game will be available in your FLGS on November 23.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PLAYING TIME:</strong> 75 mins.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PLAYER COUNT:</strong> 2-5 players.</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"c8t4f9hnufpgcptonmmi","version":{"$numberInt":"1543280498"},"signature":"6332accb2d29fb69a4656172896cc129278e7ad7","width":{"$numberInt":"640"},"height":{"$numberInt":"640"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543280498/c8t4f9hnufpgcptonmmi.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543280498/c8t4f9hnufpgcptonmmi.jpg"},"publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1542668400000"}},"amazonads":[],"metadescription":"In Narcos: The Board Game, based on the Netflix original show, one player takes on the role of the Patrón, while the others become the Factions forming a tense alliance in their search for the cartel kingpin.","metakeywords":["narcos the boardgame","narcos boardgame","boardgame colombia","map of Colombia","Sicarios","Narcos: The Board Game","narcos board game","mafia board game","board game drugs","adault board game","violent theme board game","violent theme"],"metatitle":"Narcos: the Board Game","files":[],"heroimg":"board1.jpg"},

At the start of your turn, play the top card of the Villain Deck which allows Villains and Missions to enter &ldquo;On Assignment&rdquo;, acquire Gadgets, and wreak havoc on the players in other nefarious ways. <br />Then play Hero cards from your hand to generate Attack, Recruit Points, and special abilities. You use Attack to defeat your enemies. <br />You use Recruit Points to recruit more powerful Heroes from &ldquo;Q Branch&rdquo; for your deck. Whenever your deck runs out of cards, shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, including all the new Heroes you recruited. <br />This way your deck gets stronger and stronger over time. Build up enough power, and you can defeat the Mastermind! But be careful: If the players fail too many Missions, the Mastermind wins the game!</blockquote>\r\n<p>In other words, much like other Legendary games villains will enter the game one by one, and you can defeat them with your heroes. So far so good. Each player gets 8 Agent 007\" cards and 4 \"Agent 00\" cards from the start, each with purchase power and attacking power, as usual in Legendary. But each player also gets a \"Special Starter\" depending on which Bond you are playing, there are 4 different ones, and which one goes into which game is decided by \"the Movie\".<br /><strong>The Movie</strong> is basically a <strong>combination</strong> of <strong>Mastermind</strong>, <strong>villains</strong>, <strong>henchmen</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>mission</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>extra cards</strong> which are added together.<br />For instance, there is a The Goldfinger movie scenario where&nbsp;Auric Goldfinger&nbsp;and Oddjob carries out <em>Operation Grand Slam</em>, which are the <strong>mission</strong> cards. You can defeat these like villains in various ways. Against Goldfinger stands, of course, the <strong>Sean&nbsp;</strong><strong>Connery version of Bond</strong>, which you will get a card from in your starting hand. So a bit more of a hassle than your normal Legendary game. Each movie also has <strong>two scheme cards, </strong>pick one and play.&nbsp;Mix in the master strike and scheme twist cards.<br />Another&nbsp;new thing is that you will divide the villain deck into 3 parts, A, B, and C, so things happen in a particular order (so you don't get plot twists at turn 1 etc).<br />Gadgets are basically like bystanders, you'll shuffle a few in your villain deck and keep the rest facedown on the playmat, next to the wounds. <strong>Miss Moneypenny</strong> are ally cards and can always be recruited, like <strong>Maria Hill</strong> in Marvel Legendary.<br />Add your heroes that go with the movie in a deck, and you are good to go.<br />For more details on how to play the game, please consult the&nbsp;rulebook, which you can find further down on this page.</p>\r\n<p><input name=\"IL_IN_ARTICLE\" type=\"hidden\" /></p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1552593344/bond-villains-768x549.jpg\" alt=\"Jaws, about to eat Bond\" />\r\n<figcaption>Jaws, about to eat Bond</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p hidden=\"\">The information available for the moment is from the creators is;&nbsp; &ldquo;players will be able to relive their favorite movie moments while working together to recruit their favorite characters and unravel the nefarious schemes of the most infamous 007 villains.<br /> Sounds perfect for a system like Legendary, if you ask us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543404319/galore.png\" alt=\"I see Pussy Galore!\" />\r\n<figcaption>\"I see Pussy Galore\"</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1543404319/bond.png\" alt=\"Bond, James Bond\" />\r\n<figcaption>Bond, James Bond</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"fluid\" style=\"width: 253px;\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1552593344/1500x1500_4766d9f0418d8fe330aae08d8e68eb927d1b8e3113e8866e6eaeec55.jpg\" alt=\"Xenia Onatopp\" />\r\n<figcaption>Xenia Onatopp</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p hidden=\"\">Judging by the style of these pictures, this one will be closer to Legendary: X-files rather than Marvel or Aliens.<br /> We'll look forward to fighting villains like Oddjob and Jaws while defeating masterminds like <a title=\"Hugo Drax\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Drax\" target=\"_blank\">Sir Hugo Drax</a>.</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"o7bjsudz8xee5df1ejzd","version":{"$numberInt":"1571844048"},"signature":"54134fe074359ff3aa2bdbdb54ae1558ecd362c5","width":{"$numberInt":"900"},"height":{"$numberInt":"599"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1571844048/o7bjsudz8xee5df1ejzd.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1571844048/o7bjsudz8xee5df1ejzd.jpg"},"author":{"$oid":"Jay Kay"},"publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1552431600000"}},"metadescription":"Another franchise has joined the Upper Deck's Legendary deckbuilding series, after other titles like Aliens, Firefly and Big trouble in little China; Legendary: James Bond.

Too bad this is not today's reality...</p>\r\n<p>In this Utopian society, we all will work much less. Our robots can do nearly everything already. There is no need for great envy. It is simply about equality, justice, and the fair allocation of the complete and still necessary work, which then gives us ALL more leisure time.</p>\r\n<p>Success means we will have time for the activities we like the most: fishing, farming, fencing, flying, ..., as well as gaming, building, painting, traveling, composing, and more. If somebody wants to work more than needed, they should do that. This is about the freedom! So let us rethink this: joblessness is not a disgrace, it is the new goal!</p>\r\n<p>We are members of a team striving to realize this utopian ideal. We try to develop completely self-sustaining homes that function as efficiently as possible. They must generate enough food and energy to allow the residents the greatest possible freedom (thus, leisure time). The more people in our development who no longer need to work, the closer we are to reaching our goal! The player who builds the best development will win the game, and their development will become reality!</p>\r\n<p>Futuropia is a luck-free economic game. To ensure you always encounter new challenges, we offer multiple game set-up variations, which create a variety of gameplay situations, ensuring new experiences and replayability. The solo game offers you an option to learn the mechanisms and processes of Futuropia before you play it with other players. See our hopeful future in...Futuropia!</p>"},"image":{"public_id":"gqyiwhosmdmcl6kc456l","version":{"$numberInt":"1544568654"},"signature":"e0a0f1868ca5a04cab076db0ba548017df86ff95","width":{"$numberInt":"910"},"height":{"$numberInt":"910"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544568654/gqyiwhosmdmcl6kc456l.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1544568654/gqyiwhosmdmcl6kc456l.jpg"},"metadescription":"Friedemann Friese, the man behind the excellent game \"Power Grid\", is the designer of this Economic City Building game, which comes out in January!","metatitle":"Futuropia by Friedemann Friese","publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1544482800000"}}},

Another focus will be <strong>politics</strong>, which is discussed further down in the article.</p>\r\n<h4>New corps</h4>\r\n<p>There will be new corporations as well, a Jovian based one and a corp focusing on oceans, according to the rumors, the latter has now been confirmed. The latest data suggests there will be 5 new corps; <strong>Utopia, Terralabs, Lakefront Resorts, Pristar,</strong> and one more.</p>\r\n<p>Fryxgames has released a sneak peek on two of these new corporations from Turmoil, <strong>Terralabs</strong> and <strong>Lakefront Resorts</strong>.<br /><br />Terralabs starts with just 20 MegaCredits (MC), and one less Terraforming Rating, but all cards cost 1 MC instead of the normal fee. This means you could buy your whole starting hand for just 10 MC, and all the cards in your research phase for just 4 MC. Very powerful indeed. The corporation has Science and Earth tag.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1551169679/Terra-Terralabs.jpg\" alt=\"Terralabs\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">Terralabs seems VERY powerful. This card is a Prototype.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The other corporation we've seen is Lakefront Resorts, a much more classic type of corp. It has a&nbsp;Building tag, starts with 52 MC, and as the name suggests, has something to do with lakes/oceans; When any ocean is placed, this corporation increases their MC production 1 step. Nice. But the interesting thing about this corp is the other effect, that placing tiles next to water gives you 3 MC instead of the normal 2. So, lakefront indeed.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1551169679/Terra-lakefront.jpg\" alt=\"Lakefront Resorts\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">Lakefront Resorts. Prototype!</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>These cards are still in development, and Fryxgames emphasizes that they might change. Nevertheless, interesting!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update 2019-03-30:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Terraforming Mars: Turmoil will be the only expansion to be released in 2019.</li>\r\n<li>It will be released via <strong>Kickstarter,</strong>&nbsp;and as of now, the campaign has ended<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><br />However, it will also be available at Essen 2019. </strong>This has been confirmed by Jacob.</li>\r\n<li>May very well be the <strong>final big expansion</strong> to Terraforming Mars, but we have our doubts, it IS a cash-cow after all.</li>\r\n<li>It will be an&nbsp;&ldquo;expert&rdquo; expansion, meant for more experienced players.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Politics</strong> will be a major part of this expansion;&nbsp;Mars has established a Martian Senate, with different political parties with their own agendas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Update 2019-04-07</h4>\r\n<h4>Politics</h4>\r\n<p>The political aspect will take place on a new board, the Terraforming Committee Board. Here, players will influence the 6 political parties on Mars; The Mars First Party, The Scientists, The Reds, The Greens, The Kelvinists, and The Unit Party. Players will place their own delegates and vote for the different parties, placing 1 delegate is free, the rest cost 5MC each. All players have 6 delegates each.<br />When a party is elected as the \"Ruling Party\", they will impose their policies, which will result in various bonuses, penalties and rulings on the various mechanics in the game. Example: The Greens will give you 4MC each time you place a greenery while they are the ruling party. Each party also gives you different bonuses when they are elected.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1554799346/pic4672398.jpg\" alt=\"the Terraforming Committee Board\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The Terraforming Committee Board. Keep in mind that these are prototype components!</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Of course, there are loads more to this part of the expansion than this, but let's not spoil it all, shall we?</p>\r\n<h4>Global events</h4>\r\n<p>Like we have mentioned before, this expansion consists of two modules, where politics is the first, and global events the other. As the name suggests, these events will affect the whole planet, and therefore all players. These events will be drawn from a deck in and placed out face up so you will know what is coming 3 generations before the event is activated. Some events will affect the players in a negative manner, and some will give them boosts to the production of certain resources, etc. Some events will interact with politics as well. INTERESTING!</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1554800548/pic4672394.jpg\" alt=\"The global events\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">The global events.

On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-0\">&nbsp;The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in front of them, whether in hand or on the table. Each different number card in hand gets you one white token (worth 1 point) while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). If you played all your cards, you can return one token that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-0\">&nbsp;The game ends the round that at least one player has forty or more total points.

Tolkien&rsquo;s iconic world, embodying heroes of the Free Peoples and fighting back against the oppressive might of Sauron. You&rsquo;ll battle villainous foes, make courageous choices, and strike a blow against the evil that threatens the land&mdash;all as part of a thrilling campaign that leads you across the storied hills and dales of Middle-earth.</p>\r\n<p>Each individual game of Journeys in Middle-earth is a single adventure in a larger campaign. You&rsquo;ll explore the vast and dynamic landscapes of Middle-earth, using your skills to survive the challenges you encounter on these perilous quests. As you and your fellow heroes explore the wilderness and battle the dark forces arrayed against you, the game&rsquo;s free companion app guides you to reveal the looming forests, quiet clearings, and ancient halls of Middle-earth, while also controlling the enemies you encounter. Whether you&rsquo;re venturing into the wild on your own or with close companions by your side, you can write your own legend in the history of Middle-earth.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1-5 Players</li>\r\n<li>120-180 min gameplay</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Mechanics&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Area Movement</li>\r\n<li>Cooperative Play</li>\r\n<li>Deck Building</li>\r\n<li>Hand Management</li>\r\n<li>Modular Board</li>\r\n<li>Role Playing</li>\r\n<li>Partnerships</li>\r\n<li>Variable Player Powers</li>\r\n<li>Dependent of a App&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Components</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cards</li>\r\n<li>25 Miniatures</li>\r\n<li>Chits</li>\r\n<li>Modular Board components</li>\r\n<li>Player Mats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Core Set includes 6 different heroes to play, al with unique stats like might, wisdom, agility, spirit and wit.

As a small Hobbit, on the other hand, Bilbo Baggins primarily shies away from fights. With a clever mind like his, though, he has little need for protection from other characters. Instead, he can cling to the shadows as a self-sufficient burglar who won&rsquo;t easily succumb to fear.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Each hero&rsquo;s skills and special abilities will come handy at different obstacles during gameplay.&nbsp;As you interact with the creatures and locations of Middle-earth, your hero will rely on their own unique deck of skill cards to overcome the challenges they face. Rather than leaving a player&rsquo;s fate up to a roll of the dice, the heroes must turn to their skill deck while exploring, encountering threats, attacking enemies, and interacting with the people of Middle-earth. To perform a skill test, a player simply reveals cards from the top of their skill deck equal to the value of their tested skill, hoping to reveal enough success icons to pass the test.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/b0/fe/b0fe6559-e359-48d5-bc59-8ca2734f9489/jme01_a1_diagram.png\" alt=\"Bilbo\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Example of three drawn cards, which of one is a success.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Cards are obivously used for more than test of skills, you can also place them on your mat and use their abilities. So there's a balance between the abilities and the skill tests. There are basic cards, which all heroes has access to, aswell as personal cards for each hero. In addition to the hero&rsquo;s personal skill cards, your hero&rsquo;s skill deck is also determined by choosing one of six roles! These roles invite you to play to different strengths within your Fellowship&mdash;in one adventure, you may lead your friends down unseen paths as your group&rsquo;s Pathfinder, while in the next you could become a Hunter, attacking the enemies that stand in your way. You could take on a new role in each new adventure or choose to deepen your skill in your current role, ultimately giving you the freedom to experiment with dozens of combinations of characters and roles over the course of a campaign.</p>\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen your hero and your role, it's time to start playing. The adventure is taking place on a modular map of hexagons, and you'll add new modules as you explore.&nbsp;&nbsp;This are the primary building block for many of your adventures, and the possibilities for what you can encounter are nearly limitless. You may find yourself trekking through a primeval forest, investigating ancient ruins, or delving into a gloomy cave or Dwarven hall. As you move from place to place, you&rsquo;ll be able to further investigate your surroundings and explore by interacting with search, threat, and person tokens in the app.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/9b/9d/9b9d3e7a-92ba-4563-98d6-ca61aed20f89/jme01_a1_screenshot_2.png\" alt=\"The Map\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">The modular map.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>There are also situation where you will be thrown in to micro-scale tactical combat, and this is where the app comes in controlling monsters and taking over the narrative, so you can focus on defeating the monsters.

Not using all your credit track? Why not trade in the top part of it to get a useful die? Or, if you're running a large economy and need a credit track that goes to 11 (or even 16), why not trade away a couple of white dice to get a larger track?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Have a bunch of extra tiles clogging up your construction zones from previous Explores? Why not trade them in for new dice? Or, a chance to draw from the bag until you find a 6 cost development? Or a pair of VP chips? Or a talent counter? Or some credits? Or, another Leader die? Or, a chance to draw a world of a desired color from the bag? Or, to turn some Citizenry dice directly into Developers or Settlers? Or...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Seven deal dice are rolled each turn before players assign their workers to determine what asset types can be potentially gained or traded in that round. After you swap assets, your deal will start to mature over several rounds. If you (or someone else) calls \"Deal\" again before your deal expires, then you might want to send another dealer in to reverse your trade, trading back for what you originally spent and making some credits and talent counters along the way. Of course, while your deal is maturing, some other player might swoop in and reverse it before you wanted to, taking their cut and converting your attempted temporary loan into a permanent exchange. These things happen...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&bull; <strong>The Orb Game</strong> gives one yellow \"Alien Orb\" die to each player, and the faces of these dice can be popped out and upgraded to various \"lines\" of faces that allow you to customize what you can do in the game. (Think of the lines as being akin to a tech tree.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;You can assign dice to become researchers in the Research phase, and for each assigned researcher, when someone calls Research, you get two \"dots\" of upgrades to your dice. The first dot gets you a 1-dot face in any line; extra dots get you better faces in that line. (If you want to switch lines for a given face after entering a line, pay 1 dot more.) These upgraded dice affect your play. For example, if you roll the 2-dot beige -1 develop face, you receive a -1 die discount on all developments you build that turn.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Orb dice are rolled in front of player screens at the start of a round. If, for example, you roll a face that grants virtual workers, then everyone knows that you will benefit if Explore occurs and can plan accordingly as they assign their dice and decide which phase to call.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;To allow improved Orb dice more opportunities to affect play, the Orb game ends at 15+ tiles or when the initial VP chip pool is exhausted, which is increased to 15 VPs per player. At game end, each 2-dot and 4-dot face on your Orb die is worth 1 and 2 VPs, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The expansion <strong>will not make the game longer</strong>, according to Tom Lehman, except for the first few games, obviously.</p>\r\n<p>Tom har also confirmed that the expansion <strong>will fit inside the base game</strong> box togheter with Ambition.</p>\r\n<p>Pick up the expansion <a title=\"Roll for the Galaxy Rivalry\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N3CXCRZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=boardgamene01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07N3CXCRZ&amp;linkId=c0982790cab45ebeaf4992e1652df5df\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and the base game <a title=\"Roll for the Galaxy Base game\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OYUZRIW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=boardgamene01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00OYUZRIW&amp;linkId=c84d6e80ca3078666a90dd406af83a4d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

Players can strive to change these forms, for their own advantage, and thereby alter the very rules of the game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When the government type changes, those on the top and bottom tend to change places. Can you see the change coming? How do you prepare for it? Or will you be the one actually triggering it? Once the change happens, how do you cope? All make for interesting challenges.</p>\r\n<h4>Class Warfare in Ancient Times</h4>\r\n<p>Each player represents a specific class &ndash; Aristocrats, Merchants or Farmers &ndash; with its own Statesmen, (dis)advantages and goals. Which will you play?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Aristocrats have the most Statesmen, several of them generals with great ability, but face declining revenues and so may conspire to subvert Democracy and set up an Oligarchy. Merchants have the best revenue potential and benefit from Democracy, but talented Statesmen are rarer. Farmers have good potential revenue, though often endangered by war, but have some of the best Orators, including Pericles and Themistocles. Often there is another player of your class with whom you can ally, but at times you will come into conflict with them as well and find yourself allying with other classes. Consequently no class has an unbalancing advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is a The Republic of Rome-style game with a number of changes to reflect the situation, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Markedly different Persuasion rules</li>\r\n<li>Five possible Military leaders per turn</li>\r\n<li>Hidden Popularity</li>\r\n<li>Ostracism</li>\r\n<li>Ageing Statesmen</li>\r\n<li>Act of Zeus cards</li>\r\n<li>Wars and Enemy Leaders to suit the period</li>\r\n<li>Laws that change the voting rules</li>\r\n<li>Card drafting</li>\r\n<li>Coups</li>\r\n<li>Democratic Resistance to Oligarchy</li>\r\n<li>Restrictions on Income redistribution&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>But in the final analysis the only real question is, are you smart and savvy enough to survive and thrive where Pericles and Athens could not?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The rules are avaible <a title=\"Links for the rules\" href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/athens:-the-birth-of-politics#downloadablefiles\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"twfhfo68sfczravcwc6u","version":{"$numberInt":"1548000198"},"signature":"74fce1244758a863a31699a774edbe3899a252ef","width":{"$numberInt":"400"},"height":{"$numberInt":"400"},"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1548000198/twfhfo68sfczravcwc6u.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1548000198/twfhfo68sfczravcwc6u.png"},"metadescription":"In Athens: the Birth of Politics, players struggle with Persians, Spartans and their own people on the way to a great empire.","metatitle":"Athens: The Birth of Politics","publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1547938800000"}},"files":[]},

They collect resources to build cities, a transportation network, and the&nbsp;facilities necessary to support life under the sea. Everything is accomplished by playing cards to choose various actions. If the card matches the action, the player also gains a benefit from the card. At times, the action may be so important that the player will choose it even with a nonmatching card. At other times, the benefit of the card may be so good that any action is acceptable as long as the card matches it.

A of now, no details of mechanics or the like is avaible, what the publisher has announced is this:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>The video game phenomenon Minecraft comes to your table as a board game experience filled with epic adventures! More info coming soon.</em></p>\r\n<p>Well, not a lot to go on, but rest assured that when any details emerge, you can read about it here.<br /> Until then, feel free to post your speculations below.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update 2019-09-29</strong></p>\r\n<p>So, the game is apparently coming out very soon, the <a title=\"Amazon\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXSJMHF/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=boardgamene01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07PXSJMHF&amp;linkId=cbe88d3c78ae85218db058ecd4fbee70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1st of October i Europe</a>, and the 15th of October in the US and the rest of the world.</p>\r\n<p>The game will be designed by Prospero Hall studio which has released a lot of titles lately, like <a title=\"Jaws\" href=\"http://www.boardgame-news.com/news/post/jaws-board-game\" target=\"_blank\">Jaws</a> and <a title=\"Villainous Evil Comes Prepared\" href=\"http://www.boardgame-news.com/news/post/villainous-evil-comes-prepared\" target=\"_blank\">Villainous</a>, so there is a legit gaming studio behind this and hopefully not just another cash-grab on a well-known franchise.</p>\r\n<p>The game will not be called Minecraft the Board Game like previously announced, it has changed to <strong>Minecraft Builders and Biomes - a Minecraft Board Game</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the description of the game from the publisher:</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\r\n<p>As in the original Minecraft digital game, in <em><strong>Minecraft: Builders &amp; Biomes</strong></em> players explore the Overworld, build structures, and mine resources, earning points for structures and the largest connected biomes of forest, desert, mountain, or snowy tundra spaces on their player boards.</p>\r\n<p>Familiar foes like Endermen, Creepers, and other mobs also appear throughout the game, and they need to be defeated using weapons collected from the board. Defeating mobs earn players points in addition to granting additional awards. Game scoring occurs as the resource cube's layers are depleted. As soon as the third layer runs out, the adventure comes to an end, and the builder with the most points wins.</p>\r\n<p>In more detail, on a turn you take two different actions from the following possibilities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Collect two blocks:</strong> At the start of the game, you set up a 4x4x4 cube of building blocks with 16 wood, 14 sand, 12 stone, 10 obsidian, and 12 emerald being placed together at random. When you collect a block, the top face and at least two other sides must be revealed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Move:</strong> Your character starts in the center of a 4x4 grid of tile stacks, with each stack holding four tiles. Weapon tiles are placed at the end of each column and row. Move 0-2 spaces between stacks, then reveal all adjacent tiles that are face down.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Build:</strong> Discard blocks from your personal supply to match the building requirements on a tile next to your character. Place this tile on your personal 3x3 building board.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Fight a mob:</strong> Choose a mob adjacent to your character, then reveal three tiles from your weapon stack, which starts with a stone sword, a wooden sword, and three poisonous potatoes. Tally the number of hearts revealed; if this sum is at least as large as the number of hearts on the mob, you defeat it. Remove it from the board, and place it next to your personal building board. Mobs might grant you an endgame scoring bonus, immediate points, or a one-shot bonus action.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Collect a weapon:</strong> If your character is next to a weapon tile at the edge of the playing grid, you can shuffle it into your weapon stack.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Scoring takes place three times during the game, specifically after the final block is removed from the first, second, and third level of the building block cube. In the first round, you choose one of the four biomes (forest, desert, mountains, or snowy tundra) and score for the largest connected area of this biome on your personal building board. The board comes pre-printed with biome spaces, and as you place buildings on this board, you can alter the biome of a space. In the second round, you choose one of three materials (wood, sand, stone, or obsidian) and score for the largest connected group of structures on your personal building board that are made of this material. In the third round, you score for the largest contiguous group of structures (decoration, dwelling, animal house, or bridge) of your choice on your board. After scoring in the third round, tally bonus points from the mobs you've collected.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Sounds clear?

This expansion will consist of three different modules, two \"core\" modules and one smaller module with new achievement tiles.</p>\r\n<p>The first core module consists of new tiles, <strong>the grizzly tiles</strong>, very big, hard-to-fit tiles which obviously means they are harder to fit in, but they also give more points. This also means you&nbsp;can finish your park faster if you go down this route... To accommodate more tiles in your park, you may now add a fifth park section.<br />You can aquire one of the grizzly tiles by discarding two tiles in your personal supply.</p>\r\n<p>The second core module is the <strong>Monorail</strong>. Every time you place a green tile in your park, you are also allowed to place a monorail pillar on 1 space of the field you just placed.&nbsp;Then,&nbsp;you can place more pillars on new green fields, and if you have placed them correctly, you can then connect the two pillars with a monorail for points.

A movie, which they were very involved in doing:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>District 9 was one of the most successful movies of 2009, nominated for 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture. Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson, the film explored race relations through the language of science fiction. The guns, the aliens, the vehicles, the graphic language - the world of District 9 was designed and developed here at Weta Workshop.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The New Zealand based company has also released one board game before,&nbsp;<a title=\"GKR: Heavy Hitters website\" href=\"https://www.wetanz.com/brands/gkr-heavy-hitters\" target=\"_blank\">GKR: Heavy Hitters</a>, which has spawned a couple of expansions, so they seem to know what they are doing..</p>\r\n<p>In the game, players takes on the roles of rivaling factions in the District 9 ghetto, trying to gather the most alien technology over a 3 days time, the same 3 days the movie unfolds. The players start at different edges of the District 9, and&nbsp;by&nbsp;moving units and taking command of resources, playing cards with different abilities, interaction with various characters from the film, try to salvage as much alien technology as possible.</p>\r\n<p>As the game progresses, the unrest in District 9 escalates.&nbsp;Wikus&rsquo; actions during the prawn evictions, and the ensuing man-hunt, drive the stakes higher and higher until the climactic finale: when Wikus dons the prawn mech suit for his heroic last stand. The player who&nbsp;has gathered most technology is the winner.</p>\r\n<p>Sounds awesome?&nbsp;It dure does, and the different factions will of course have variable powers and the board will be&nbsp;modular. This means the replayability will be high as well. Player count will be 2-4 and it will take about 90-120 min to play.</p>\r\n<p>Still not convinced?&nbsp;The game is very likely to contain beautiful miniatures and stunning artwork, given the quality of Weta's work, and all these factors combined makes backing this on Kickstarter a no-brainer, especially if you are a fan of the film.</p>\r\n<p><del>The Kickstarter will begin in <strong>March 26th</strong>, and&nbsp;rest asured&nbsp;we will update this page with a link ASAP.</del></p>\r\n<p>THIS KICKSTARTER HAS BEEN <strong>CANCELED</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pick up&nbsp;GKR: Heavy Hitters <a title=\"Buy it at Amazon\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BYJQ6FN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=boardgamene01-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07BYJQ6FN&amp;linkId=760e47ecf347a77d17bb4d35fd1e70b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"jsz2dtwryhrmbnr5qp6a","version":{"$numberInt":"1551111354"},"signature":"0e110cb9942fd107bbb8496f0df21146c0149273","width":{"$numberInt":"538"},"height":{"$numberInt":"600"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1551111354/jsz2dtwryhrmbnr5qp6a.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1551111354/jsz2dtwryhrmbnr5qp6a.jpg"},"metadescription":"Weta Workshop, a movie-making firm studio, known for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Avatar and Mad Max: Fury Road, has announced a District 9: The Board Game Kickstarter Campaign","metatitle":"District 9: The Board Game Kickstarter in March!","author":{"$oid":"Jay Kay"},"publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1551049200000"}}},

Since all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival's presence can be the only way to achieve further expansion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Normally the genr&eacute; is sci-fi based games, but there are exceptions, like <strong>Clash of Cultures</strong> or <strong>Dominant Species</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>However this game is indeed Sci-fi and is best compared to behemoths like <strong>Eclipse</strong>, <strong>Twilight Imperium</strong> (TI4), <strong>Space Empires: 4X</strong>&nbsp; (SE4X), and <strong>Hyperspace</strong>.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"&quot;figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1552854569/b041cd4b7bfdb251bf7b04ec046f2579_original_1.jpg\" alt=\"A game of Silver River in progress\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">Game in progress.

Everything is faster, so no more researching a tech and then move your ship back home to upgrade, then move your ship back to the action. No more build your ships at home and then move them slowly toward the action to maybe use them before the end of the game. Upgrading your fleets and building ships is simple and fast.</li>\r\n<li>You can choose to cooperate or compete against another player: You can cohabitate with other players on a planet. You can have your fleet in the same space as another player without battling. You can team up and fight the galactic monsters! You can vote for other players for Political titles. Your trade stations benefit from being near other player's population.</li>\r\n<li>Choose your path: At the start of the game, each player has a hand of personal objectives, including political, technological, military, exploration, civilization, and miscellaneous types. Each player chooses five secretly, discarding the rest. Want to play a political and civilization based game, while dabbling in exploration? Choose those objectives and focus on your strategy.</li>\r\n<li>Passing: Unique to the genre and gaming as far as I know, we have a Domestic Investment track. When you pass for the Age, you move up on one of 4 tracks here, which gives you an immediate bonus and may be worth VP at the end of the game. This not only incentivizes quick, efficient turns, it adds a layer of strategy and planning about how to accomplish your goals in as few turns and efficiently as possible. This adds a great puzzly aspect to the game.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are a ton more things that I think make the gameplay here really stand out above the competition, but these are a few of the highlights.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Sounds good, right? Here's the official description from the publisher:</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\r\n<p>The game includes Humans and different alien races, many of which some believe really exist in our galaxy like the:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Greys</li>\r\n<li>Arcturians</li>\r\n<li>Reptilians</li>\r\n<li>Yahyel</li>\r\n<li>Pleiadians</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Silver River was built to provide a rich 4X experience (Explore, Expand, Exploit &amp; Exterminate), with all its trappings in under 2 hours.</p>\r\n<p>Players will take the role of one alien civilization, and work to earn victory points through exploration, colonization, technology, civilization building, politics, war, and peace.</p>\r\n<p>Unique ideas include:</p>\r\n<p>Simulteneous Production and Resource Allocation: Gain raw production equal to your civilization's population each turn, and then allocate it to your areas of choice during simultaneous Governing phases. Use your allocated resources to take actions.</p>\r\n<p>True Exploration: Explore planet-less sectors for rewards. Uncover mini-quests to be completed by the end of the round for victory points.</p>\r\n<p>Choose War, or Choose Peace: Players may enter any occupied sector without forcing war, players always have the option to attack, or not to attack, and may even agree to co-habitate planets together.</p>\r\n<p>Fast Tech Upgrades and Ship Movement: Move fleets of ships, whose size is not visible until they arrive, not individual ships. Upgraded technology applies instantly to all ships/planets/etc. This provides real progression in less time, and with less micromanagement.</p>\r\n<p>Ally Against Common Enemies: The center of the map is Sagittarius A*, a place where massive space monsters can be hunted for great rewards, on your own, or with other players.</p>\r\n<p>Choose Your Victory Conditions: Players will have the ability to choose their victory conditions before the game starts to ensure every player can play the strategies they love, and avoid those they dislike.

The game supports <strong>2 - 6 players</strong> and takes <strong>1 - 3 hours</strong> to play.&nbsp;<br />The thing is, this is the kind of game you and a group of likeminded individuals has to invest some time into to really enjoy, it will take you a couple of games (spanning&nbsp;3 hours) to wrap your heads around. The reason it will take 3 hours to play is that you want to play this game with at least 4 players, preferably with 5 or 6. It is unforgiving, like a game of war should be. These facts put together might be a reason this game is not for you, but then again it very well might be.</p>\r\n<p>To put it short, this game is freaking awesome if you have the time and energy for 2-3 hour-long games because you will get rewarded with a truly unique gameplay experience lacking in most modern games today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We will not go through the gameplay here, but we might do a review later, meanwhile, read the <a title=\"Dune rulebook\" href=\"http://boardgame-news.com/rules/Dune_Rulebook.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Dune rulebook</a>, and check out the artwork below.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1572783461/pic4960808.jpg\" alt=\"Dune the board game board\" />\r\n<figcaption>Here's the updated board.

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.</p>\r\n<p>Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1554233027/pic4666623.png\" alt=\"Ticket to Ride London board\" />\r\n<figcaption>The Ticket to Ride: London board looks simple enough.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Ticket to Ride: London supports 2-4 players, and will take about 10-15 minutes to play.<br /> The game is due in June for Europe, which will have versions in English, French, German, Polish and Italian, and US customers will have to wait to July.

It will be released in Q3 of 2019.<br /> The publisher has this to say about the game:</p>\r\n<blockquote>The Neo-Babylonian empire, especially under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 B.C.), was a period of rebirth for southern Mesopotamia. Irrigation systems improved and expanded, increasing agricultural production. Urban life flourished with the creation of new cities, monuments and temples, and the consequent increase in trade.<br /> In Babylonia, you try to make your clan prosper under the peace and imperial power of that era. You have to place your nobles, priests, and craftsmen tokens on the map to make your relations with the cities as profitable as possible. Properly placing these counters next to the court also allows you to gain the special power of some rulers. Finally, the good use of your peasants in the fertile areas gives more value to your crops. The player who gets the most points through all these actions wins.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Reiner Knizia games are always interesting and we're a bit suprised there's so little buzz around this title, and as soon as we know more, we will update this page.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, be sure to pick up classic titles like <a title=\"Samurai at Amazon\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2It0EE7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samurai</a>, <a title=\"Lost Cities at Amazon\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2GgARxw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lost Cities</a>, <a title=\"Ra at Amazon\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2Gl3A4p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra</a> or Reiner Knizia's masterpiece <a title=\"Tigris and Euphrates at Amazon\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2Z5BalX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tigris &amp; Euphrates</a>.

Fractures adds a new area for worker placement, the Amythenia Valley, an area where humanity has learned to survive and collect the powerful Flux resource. Flux can be used to allow Exosuited workers to &ldquo;blink&rdquo; &ndash; essentially existing in two worker spaces at once. However the Fracture Devices used to create Flux are far from perfect, and must be maintained by the new Operator worker type, or else temporal glitches ensue. Fractures of Time also adds a 5th faction to the game, the Path of Unity, consisting of dissidents from the other 4 factions, residing in a capitol city sent back from the future. Also in the expansion are a new Exosuit type &ndash; the Paladin, and a new Solo mode, as well as a giant Infinity Box, if you back the expansion + base game, to hold everything together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This expansion is designed by <strong>Richard Amann</strong>, <strong>Viktor Peter</strong>, and <strong>D&aacute;vid Turczi</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Oh, and <a title=\"Anachrony: Fractures of Time Expansion and Infinity Box\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/438141406/anachrony-fractures-of-time-expansion-and-infinity\" target=\"_blank\">here's the link to the kickstarter</a>.

You'll travel the outer rim in your personal ship, hire legendary Star Wars characters to join your crew, and try to become the most famous (or infamous) outlaw in the galaxy!</p>\r\n<p>But it won't be easy since the warring factions of the galaxy roam the outer rim, hunting down the scum that have proven to be a thorn in their side, and other scoundrels looking to make their mark see you as the perfect target to bring down to bolster their own reputation. Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?</p>\r\n<p>In more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame. Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character's personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits.</p>\r\n<p>While the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship. Your player board not only tracks your fame progress, but also contains slots for your ship, your character card, gear, reputation, modifications, jobs, and bounties.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558858830/pic4566668.png\" alt=\"Star Wars: Outer Rim cards\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Star Wars: Outer Rim cards.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Like stated above, the game is due in June, and the <strong>MSRP is $65.&nbsp;</strong>Get it right <a title=\"Buy Star Wars: Outer Rim\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2M8yYYE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"ay3kipj9xfawmaz73zys","version":{"$numberInt":"1558858904"},"signature":"efccc11c0583aa0067a350ca0b688536f4b6a2ad","width":{"$numberInt":"500"},"height":{"$numberInt":"530"},"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558858904/ay3kipj9xfawmaz73zys.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1558858904/ay3kipj9xfawmaz73zys.png"},"metadescription":"Finally, non-RPG players will be able to take part of the Star Wars: Outer Rim universe on your gaming table.

In the land of Fabulosa, powerful magics have rendered war obsolete. With nothing else to compete for, the bored populace has turned to the Super Brawl for entertainment. These same powerful magics are now used to reach back into the timelines to pluck out the finest warriors from every civilization in order to compete against each other in the greatest entertainment spectacle ever staged.</p>\r\n<p><em>Super Fantasy Brawl</em> is a fun, fast-paced competitive miniatures board game. Players select a team of three champions and combine their unique action cards to create a synergistic action deck. The game is faction-free, so players have their choice of any combination of champions they wish. Each turn, the players use their hand of action cards to maneuver, attack, displace enemies, and claim objectives to score victory points.</p>\r\n<p>As the wizards who oversee the Super Brawl ensure that all champions are returned back to their timeline unharmed and unaware, champions cannot be killed. Instead, a champion who is taken out returns to the field of play whilst the champion who delivered the blow is leveled-up to an even more powerful version of themselves &mdash; but if your leveled-up champion is taken out, then it returns to the action reset back to its less powerful version.</p>\r\n<p>Every action card in <em>Super Fantasy Brawl</em> is attributed to one of the three cores which govern all magic in Fabulosa: creation, destruction, and manipulation. Each turn, players may play up to one action card of each core. Doing so exhausts their connection to that core until the end of the turn when their hand will be replenished and the cores readied.</p>\r\n<p>The objectives in <em>Super Fantasy Brawl</em> are only scored at the beginning of a players' turn, ensuring that you always get a chance to disrupt your enemy's plans and position your champions to score the objective for yourself. This tactical to-and-fro continues until one player reaches the victory point threshold, declaring themselves the winner and advancing towards victory in the Super Brawl tournament!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1561488134/sfb_date_tsu_xiao_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Super Fantasy Brawl cards\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figcaption\">Super Fantasy Brawl cards</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Super Fantasy Brawl will launch on Kickstarter on June 25th and will hit retail stores in Q2 2020.<strong>The kickstarter is live; click <a title=\"Kickstarter\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1162110258/super-fantasy-brawl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</strong></p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"g6iadta4evdb5bwccksp","version":{"$numberInt":"1561488661"},"signature":"9938d95c000f928d4725f6b32fc08187586675ba","width":{"$numberInt":"600"},"height":{"$numberInt":"600"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1561488661/g6iadta4evdb5bwccksp.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1561488661/g6iadta4evdb5bwccksp.jpg"},"metadescription":"A fighting style board game is Launching on Kickstarter on June 25th.

Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations.

It's worth 1 VP, and obviously a very nice way to get rid of those basic SHIELD agent cards. We like!!</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>The Masterminds will be&nbsp;<strong>HYDRA High Council</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Super Adaptoid</strong>. These Mastersminds will be <em>Adapting Masterminds</em>, and will work like this; <br />A normal Mastermind has a Mastermind card and 4 Mastermind Tactic cards. An Adapting Mastermind instead has just 4 Mastermind Tactic cards. Whichever Tactic is currently on top of the stack of Tactics counts as the current Mastermind card. When it's time for a master strike, the current tactic will be performed, and then the Mastermind will <strong>Adapt</strong>. As in you shuffle the remaining tactics and perhaps a new tactic will get on top, changing the Mastermind completely.

Why? Because we say so.

Obviously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As for bystanders, new keywords, etc who knows? Will there FINALLY be a cross-dimensional Thor rampage? <br />There is a big chance the <strong>Artifacts</strong> from Guardians of the Galaxy will be back, seeing how the Asgardians love their divine weapons.&nbsp;</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"tangjlgnsoorym1detk5","version":{"$numberInt":"1575017950"},"signature":"bef10bbfe4ce2dcf55c123fcd142483f6f2cb512","width":{"$numberInt":"607"},"height":{"$numberInt":"637"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1575017950/tangjlgnsoorym1detk5.webp","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1575017950/tangjlgnsoorym1detk5.webp"},"metadescription":"Read on about this coming expansion to Marvel: Legendary.

Here we are a couple of years later and now it's time for the 13th expansion;&nbsp;<strong>Dominion: Menagerie</strong>. Let's have a quick look.</p>\r\n<p>Note that this article assumes you are familiar with Dominion and previous expansions!</p>\r\n<p>Dominion: Menagerie brings 400 new cards, divided like this; <strong>30 different Kingdom</strong> cards, 40 landscape cards;&nbsp;<strong>Events</strong> and <strong>Ways</strong>. There will also be <strong>30 Horse</strong> cards. The remaining 30 cards are randomizer cards for the Kingdom cards. It also comes with <strong>Exile</strong> playmats.</p>\r\n<p>So let's get the Landscape cards out of the way first.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Events</strong> are returning from sets like <em>Adventures</em> and <em>Empires</em>, which essentially are 2-3 cards you will add each time you play and they have effects you can pay for to use during the Buy phase, how many times you would want.<br /><strong>Ways</strong> are new for this expansion and they are laid out much like events but instead of being used in the Buy phase, the effects on these cards can be used instead of the action card you just played.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1584959200/wayoftheox.png\" alt=\"Way of the Ox a new type of card in Dominion: Menagerie\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">For example, you can choose this effect instead of the effect on your Smithy card you just played for +2 actions. Now you can play your other Smithy card you have in hand and still have 1 action left. Freaking awesome.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>Next up, <strong>Horses</strong>. These are not in the supply, they are special cards you can gain from playing other cards, and are usable 1 time and the returned to the pile. Kind of like <em>Spoils</em> from <em>Dark Ages</em> works, except this is an Action card.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1584960312/horse.png\" alt=\"Dominion: Menagerie Horse card\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">As you can see this is pretty straight-forward, a one-time use <em>Laboratory</em>.

Supplies is nice; it's like a copper and every time you play it you will get a horse on top of your deck.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p><strong>Exile</strong><br />There are some cards that allow you to \"Exile\" cards, which means, put them on your exile mat. Pretty much the same way <em>Island</em> works in <em>Dominion: Seaside</em>, but cards in Exile can also come back to your deck and discard pile in various ways. <strong>The cards in exile are included in scoring at the end.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dominion: Menagerie will also feature <strong>Duration</strong> cards and <strong>Reaction</strong> cards, and all in all this looks like a pretty fun set.

The 2 boxes will stack nicely.</li>\r\n<li>The game will be launched in <strong>English</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It will probably cost around $100 + shipping.</li>\r\n<li>The insert will be similar to Gloomhavens but improvements will be made where possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There will be sixteen characters in total from the get-go with Frosthaven. Of these, six are starting characters.</li>\r\n<li>The loot system will be the same as Gloomhaven.</li>\r\n<li>While you <strong>could</strong> transfer your character from Gloomhaven, but Frosthaven is designed to be played from level 1.</li>\r\n<li>There will be a lot of monsters returning from Gloomhaven, but obviously there will be a lot of new ones as well.</li>\r\n<li>There will be balancing in the late game with the issues with Gloomhaven in mind.</li>\r\n<li>Solo scenarios will be available from the start.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All the data above is summarized from an interview with Isaac Childres, the designer.

The theme is the only thing lacking in the game though. Now it's time for a sequel,&nbsp;<strong>Winter Kingdom</strong>. Let's have a look.</p>\r\n<p>Description from the publisher</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\r\n<p><strong>Winter Kingdom</strong> features seven, double-sided hexagonal map tiles that are randomly arranged into the playing area. After that, three scoring conditions, one economy card (showing how players earn money), and one twist card are dealt, giving the unique features of the game. Each player is dealt five ability cards and one terrain card.</p>\r\n<p>On your turn, you must place three houses in the terrain depicted on your terrain card. If possible, you must place the houses next to previously placed houses. (If not possible, they may be placed anywhere that matches the terrain on the card.) You also start the game with a limited number of forts, which can replace any house and which count as two pieces.</p>\r\n<p>After placing houses, you may use your gold to make one purchase, either paying the cost to put one ability card into play or paying an additional cost on a previously placed ability to upgrade it. Once purchased, the ability may be used once per turn for the rest of the game. You start the game with a little gold to buy abilities and can earn more gold based on the economy card in play for that game.</p>\r\n<p>The game ends once one player is out of both houses and forts. Players score based on the criteria of the scoring cards for that game; in addition, whoever has the most houses next to each castle scores 3 additional points. The player with the most points wins.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>As you have probably gathered, the gameplay is like Kingdom Builder but with extra stuff:</p>\r\n<p>First off, you will start with <strong>4 forts</strong> on top of the 32 houses, which are worth 2 houses, which in itself opens up for a lot of strategic and tactical choices.</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, <strong>money</strong> is introduced, which you will use to buy special abilities rather than just getting them when building close to a point in the map like in Kingdom Builder.</p>\r\n<p>There are now <strong>6 types of terrain</strong> instead of just 5.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, if players would like to switch up the rules they play, even more, they can choose one of the eight <strong>twist cards</strong>. These cards change&nbsp;the rules of the game, making different ways to&nbsp;score possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1585643768/8b46ee8e244cc2c5a304646aef2a307e_original.jpg\" alt=\"Winter Kingdom Kickstarter components.\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Winter Kingdom Kickstarter components.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>All in all, this sounds very cool, but if buying this is warranted if you have Kingdom Builder + a ton of expansions is debatable.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.</p>\r\n<p>This is the Dice version of Terraforming Mars by Jacob Fryxelius.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>That was the description from Fryxgames regarding this. Sounds about right. So what do we know about mechanics and gameplay?</p>\r\n<p>Obviously, the game will revolve around throwing dice, of which there are 5 different ones;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The green die, called the \"bio\" die, will have plants (3), microbes (2), and animals (1) on it.</li>\r\n<li>The yellow die deals with money (3)&nbsp;and science (2) and another resource (1).</li>\r\n<li>The&nbsp;red die will have heat (3), space events (2), and another (1) resource&nbsp;on them.</li>\r\n<li>The blue die will represent water (3), electricity (2) and&nbsp;oxygen (1).</li>\r\n<li>Finally, there's a grey die which will have steel (3), titanium (2), and cities (1) on it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The number within parenthesis are the number of sides with the symbol in question. Since there's supposed to be 3 different resources on each dice perhaps someone could enlighten us of the missing resource on the yellow and red dice? Maybe&nbsp;a Jovian on the red one and Earth of the yellow one?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You will still be terraforming the planet, as in raise temperature, oxygen levels, and get the water flowing on the red planet. Furthermore,&nbsp;Jonathan from Fryxgames says this game will be Terraforming Mars light, and gameplay should be around 60 minutes. There will be a lot of cards, with the artwork and feel of the original game.<br />Players will still have their own corporation with unique abilities and will start with 5 cards.</p>\r\n<p>During the game, players will take turns being the starting player, much like Terraforming Mars. The players will take dice according to their production and add it to their pool. If a die of a certain color is depleted, players may choose a die from any other color. When everyone has their dice they roll them and either buy cards with their dice, perform actions on cards, purchase new cards, or take standard actions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Trade 2 red heat symbols dice to raise the temperature.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 3 plant&nbsp;dice to&nbsp;place plants on the map.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 2 blue water dice to place water.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 2 blue oxygen dice to raise the oxygen level.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 3 metal city dice to build a city.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 1&nbsp;yellow science dice to draw a card.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 4&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;money dice to place a city, greenery, water, or raise the temperature.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 1 dice to turn another dice in your collection to a side of your choice.</li>\r\n<li>Freeze a dice on your corporation, to be used in later rounds.</li>\r\n<li>Trade 1 card for 1 dice of your choice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<figure class=\"figure\"><img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1585742188/TMDice.jpg\" alt=\"Terraforming Mars the Dice Game prototype components.\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Here's an image of TM the Dice Game prototype components.

Cities and water scores 2 points, plants 1 point for each adjacent city, and 1 point for raising the oxygen level.

But what does this mean? Well, let's find out.</p>\r\n<p>The details are not 100% clear at this point, but here's what we know so far;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The box itself will be 30,5cm x 30,5cm&nbsp;with an&nbsp;impressive height of 20cm. In inches, this would be&nbsp;12&Prime; x 12&Prime; x 8&Prime;. Should be plenty of rooms for all expansions.</li>\r\n<li>20 promo cards.</li>\r\n<li>2 new corporations have been confirmed;&nbsp;<strong>Pharmacy Union</strong> and <strong>AstroDrill</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Loads of 3D tiles; 24 cities with 6 different designs, 40 green tiles with 5 different designs, 9 ocean tiles, and all the special tiles, as well as 3 brand new tiles, which probably derives from 3 of the promo cards.</li>\r\n<li>New markers for the global parameters.</li>\r\n<li>Card dividers</li>\r\n<li>All of this will price att <strong>99 US dollars + shipping</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>You will have the option to add the base game and the expansions as well, if you want.</li>\r\n<li>There will be even more promo cards unlocked vai milestones in the campaign.</li>\r\n<li>You will <strong>NOT</strong> be able to opt-out the 3d tiles to reduce the price.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of the above sounds nice, especially if it is in a deluxe type of fashion. But&nbsp;it also leaves us a bit puzzled, one would expect new cubes as the ones in the game are quite low quality, one would expect nice sturdy inserts, on would expect dual-layer boards (even though previously released in the Turmoil campaign, but not everyone backed it, and rightfully so), etc.&nbsp;<br />Maybe these will indeed be included, maybe they will be stretch goals or add-ons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully, there won't be enough \"expansion stuff\" to prompt people who already have a nice storage solution, 3D tiles, and all the expansion to buy this, as that would be crazy.

The residents of the cities however, took the bonfires for granted and exploited them for their personal gain. Disappointed the guardians of light retreated and let the bonfires extinguish. The citizens could no longer live in the now dark cities and were forced to leave.</p>\r\n<p>You are a group of gnomes living close to the cities and you also need and the light of the bonfires. Missing it now, you try yourself to visit the cities and learn how to ignite the bonfires once again: You must visit the guardians of light on their holy islands and ask for tasks to prove your good will. For each completed task, they will re-ignite one extinguished bonfire. Whoever manages to earn the greatest trust from the guardians and manages to brighten their city the most will win the game.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The general goal&nbsp;is to compete with the other players competing tasks for the guardians of different difficulty leves which will of course yeld more points for the more difficult tasks and less so for the easier ones. The only problem is, all players have access to the same tasks, and only the one that completes them first can reap the rewards.</p>\r\n<p>To achieve this you will&nbsp;complete different actions which you will get from action tiles, which in turn is gained by placing fate tiles into your privare board in a clever way. You will also spend actions to move guardians, complete tasks, ingite bonfires etc. A lot of stuff going on in this game, and I suspect this will be a great brain-burner.</p>\r\n<p>There is way too much going on in this game to cover here, so if you are interested in more information about this, read the bonfire rule book <a title=\"bonfire rules pdf\" href=\"http://www.hallgames.de/download/bonfire_en_regeln.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>","purehtml":""},"image":{"public_id":"vnv3dqqhkf7qqdpmmh3p","version":{"$numberInt":"1602053792"},"signature":"847adde7b77c760075b6e47fc82e189699d4052a","width":{"$numberInt":"429"},"height":{"$numberInt":"600"},"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1602053792/vnv3dqqhkf7qqdpmmh3p.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/aaassdd33333/image/upload/v1602053792/vnv3dqqhkf7qqdpmmh3p.jpg"},"metadescription":"Another board game, Bonfire by Stefan Feld is due.","metatitle":"Bonfire by Stefan Feld","publishedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1602021600000"}},"saletext":"The game is released in Germany, US wil have to wait.."},
