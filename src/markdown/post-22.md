### The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Overview 
If you have no idea what this game is, you are in a good place, because you have a journey in front of you. In The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game either you or up to three friends embark on different quests set in the Middle Earth. You will be using cards in pretty much all the aspects of the game, the monsters, the events, your heroes, your spells, your weapons, etc. You will combat monsters and damage will be handled with small damage tokens. 

Each quest has a exciting narrative which you will follow and things will happen, in a very clever, thematic way, and if you like coop game, this one is a no-brainer since it simpy awesome. Is is a TCG though, so you will end up buying a lot of expansions, which is awesome for your gaming self, but no so much for your wallet.

#### What is new in the Revised Core Set?
The new cord set is mostly the same as the old one, but there are a couple of new cards included in the set, *campaign cards*, *boons*, and *burdens*. Veterans of the game will recognize these from the story line expansions of the game. These cards will be used in the new campaign mode which is also new in this new edition. Campaigns links different quests togheter, and you get to keep your boons and campaign cards between the quests. Really awesome stuff which was kind of missed in the old edition where the quests were stand-alone.
The good news for players who own the original set is that all the new cards will be available for free to print and play, check out [fantasy flights website](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/).
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game has been around now for 10 years, and the fact that a new core set is coming out should speak for itself. The game is awesome, and if you like lord of the rings and/or enjoy cooperative games, this one is, like stated above, a no-brainer.
