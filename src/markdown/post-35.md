**Brass: Pittsburgh** is the highly anticipated standalone board game from Roxley Games, **set to debut on Gamefound in early 2026**. Co-designed by Gavan Brown, known for **Brass: Birmingham**, and original Brass creator **Martin Wallace**, Brass: Pittsburgh builds on the celebrated Brass series, offering new strategic depth and innovative gameplay for fans of industrial-themed board games.

Set during America's industrial age in the late 19th century, **Brass: Pittsburgh**"** sets players in the industrial boom of the northeastern United States, particularly the Steel Belt that is centered around Pittsburgh. 
Players will take the roles of historical figures from this time like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Henry Frick, this would suggest variable player power, which would be a first for a game in the series.

Players will in a classic Brass manner establish railway networks, pipelines, etc. In this Brass Pittsburgh there will be Steel Mills, Oil Refineries, and probably a lot more stuff to use.
Being a Roxley production, the art will probably be top-notch, and the artists are: **Mr. Cuddington, Damien Mammoliti, & James Van Niekerk**

**Brass: Pittsburgh** will be a 2 - 4 player game, and playin time will be 60 - 120 minutes, but knowing the system I would say probably longer than that for most groups.

The Gamefound campaign for "Brass: Pittsburgh" is scheduled to commence on February 3, 2026, and the link to the Gamefound campaign can be found <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/roxley/brass-pittsburgh" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">here</a>.
