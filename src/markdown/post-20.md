### Overview 
In GigaWatt, the players take control of different regions of Europe, and competes which one of them that can replace all their dirty coal plants with cleaner energy plats, like wind ans solar, in the most efficient manner. Go too fast, and you will risk power outages, and go too slow, and increase the climate change rate.
The weather is controlled by random using weather dice, and players will bid for different power plats using auctions and trading with each other. You have a shortage of power right now? Ask your neighbor, she might wan't to sell you some of surplus..

Players will also want to be able to store their power, so investing in different power storage solutions will also be the way forwards, as well as invest in new technology to reach these goals.
