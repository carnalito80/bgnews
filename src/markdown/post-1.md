So, another expansion for **Marvel: Legendary** is around the corner. But it's not **Eternals** like we were led to belive earlier this year when the announced which expansions were going to be released.  
 If you have been following this site you know we have speculated quite accurately on the past expansions but, alas, this time we are not been in the loop. The next expansion for this great game will be called **Realm of Kings**.

 As of now, the expansion is even released and this is what you'll get:

 ### Heroes ###

* Black Bolt 
* Medusa 
* Karnak 
* Gorgon 
* Crystal 

### Villains ###

* Inhuman Rebellion
* Shi'Ar

### Masterminds ###

* Maximus the Mad
* Vulcan

### Schemes ###

* War of Kings
* Ruin the Perfect Wedding
* Tornade of Terrigen Mists
* Devolve with Xerogen Crystals

There's a couple of new keywords as well:  
* **Throne's Favour** An object is chosed as Throne's Favour. There is only of these in a game, and players may take it from each other or from villains/masterminds got the the said effect. Sounds like fun.
* **When Recruited** This is a straighforward mechanic that lets you do something when you recruit the hero in question.  

Of course there are some old ones returning from older sets:
* **Teleport**
* **Abonimation**
