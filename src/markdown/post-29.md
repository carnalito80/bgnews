Heroes of Might and Magic III the board game was first announced November 2022 and launched a very successful crowdfunding campaign (gathered around 3.8 million euros), and the game have been very well received, and have a score of 8.1 out of 10 on BGG currently.

The game is based on the excellent classic Heroes of Might and Magic 3 for PC, and holds very true to the original game. The game supports single player mode as well as playing with/against other players, with a total player count of 4.
Game length is about 2 hours.

This new campaign contains everything from the original campaign but there's 3 new expansions this time around, Stronghold, Conflux, and Cove. All with unique units, spells, etc.

Each new expansion also adds new mechanics and elements to the game which brings more variety to the game. The expansions include an underground, which you can enter and leave only through specific entrances. There are also islands and seas, through which you can move with a ship. Another mechanic that’s arriving is portals, which allow players to quickly move across the map.

An interesting detail is that the Cove faction is actually not a part of the original HoMM3 game but rather a fan-made expansion released a couple of years ago.

We would urge you to back this project if you are a fan of the computer game, or a fan of fantasy board games in general.
