A new game in the Terraforming Mars universe is coming 2021! This time it's a card game, and it's going to be kickstarted later this year. 
Little is known except that the fact that it's going to be an engine building card game, which will include 200 illustrated cards (this time illustrated by **William Bricker**, known for The Dragon and the Flagon among other games), and it will be faster game play than the "normal" Terraforming Mars game, said to be around 45 minutes. 
Also, the designer Jacob Fryxelius will get help from **Nick Little** (Aeon's End, Path of Light and Shadow) and **Sydney Engelstein** (Space Cadets) which is interesting.
The official description:
> is that it's an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable).
We will keep you posted on any developments that comes along.
