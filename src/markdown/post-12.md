The very underrated game Tyrants of the Underdark from 2016 is finally getting reprinted after being out of stock for years. Furthermore, this edition of the game will include the expansion *Aberrations and Undead* which is great. Apart from that, the box is a different size and the rest of the changes are purely cosmetic, so if you won the 1st edition of the game, you won't be needing this one.
If you are unfamiliar with this great game, check out our review right here: [Tyrants of the Underdark review](https://www.boardgame-news.com/reviews/details/tyrants-of-the-underdark).
You can expect this one to hit the stores this summer!
