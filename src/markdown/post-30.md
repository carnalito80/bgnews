Thinking of buying a Minecraft Puzzle for Christmas this year? Is this, the Minecraft Mobs puzzle of a thousand pieces any good? Let's have a look.

The puzzle giant **Ravensburger** is renowned for the quality of their puzzles, and we dived into this one with high expectations. Looking at the box, we knew we were in for a challenge, as there was a lot of gray looking areas, and the palette and hue was similar allover the board.
*
The puzzle is basically a collection of the mobs you would encounter in **Minecraft** divided into parts that could be described as windows of different kinds.

THe heroes are in the middle of the puzzle, and you've got your **Creepers**, **Evoker**, **Zombies**, **Ender Dragons** and a whole bunch more, even **chickens** so it certainly delivers on the mobs part.

The puzzle is obviously for fans of Minecraft, and considering it's a 1000 pieces, the target audience would be around 12-15 years old, with the exception of adults thay like Minecraft.

We found the puzzle very challenging, however, and the targeted group would probably struggle to finish this one, and a one thing made it worse.

#### Wrong colors on this Ravensburgers Minecraft puzzle ####

The image on the box and the image the puzzle is actually made of is not identical, which added a lot of confusion for an already confusing puzzle. Here, let us show you what we mean:

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="image fluid" alt="Wrong shape" src="/images/minecraft_puzzle_1.webp" >
    </img>
    <figcaption class="figcaption">To the left is the image from the box of this <strong>evoker mob</strong>, and to the right the image of the puzzle itself. </figcaption>
</figure>

In this case, we have two different stances of the mob in question.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="image fluid" alt="Wrong color" src="/images/minecraft_puzzle_2.webp" >
    </img>
    <figcaption class="figcaption">To the left is the image from the box of this <strong>skeleton mob</strong>, and to the right the image of the puzzle itself. </figcaption>
</figure>
And here we have an example of the colors being different.

If this is done by purpose or by accident is anyone's guess, but we would guess the latter, and this added a lot of confusion which wasn't very positive.

### Opinion
Board: Very good.
Cutting: Very good.
Image: Mismatch, not good.
Box: Mismatch, not good.
Fit: Excellent.
Puzzle Dust: Just a little bit, very good.
Piece cut: Standard grid.
Piece shapes: Good variety.
Finish: Very nice.

### Conclusion
This puzzle is a bit too hard for the intended audience, and when you add the confusion regarding the box and board mismatch it just becomes a mess. With that said, if you are skilled and aware of the mismatch, and really like Minecraft, by all means, pick this one up.

Not for us; **5/10**
