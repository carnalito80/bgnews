**Concordia: Mare Nostrum** is a new map in the making, which will be released "in a near future", but, if you ask us, **most likely in 2026**.

The map features the mediterranean sea, and the areas around it much like the classic Imperium Map, but with a lot of changes to the original style of play.

#### Concordia -Mare Nostrum mechanics

There are several new emchanics used on this map which fundamentaly changes the game. First of, there are no lanes, only of the in the sea. This means, when you used your architect, you will move between the regions of the map with your boat, and you may build in all cities in that particular region. Furthermore, **the land based colonists does not move on the map at all**, instead they will move on a track in the corner of a map, and collect resources on the different spots they tread, and with one move, you may tread on multiple steps. You may also skip any number of steps if you want to, but when you get to the final step, the colonist may not move again.

Example: Let's say you have 3 colonists in total, which let's you move in total 3 steps as usual. Maybe you will move to an adjacent region with your boat, and move 2 steps with a land colonist. Let's say you step on square one (collect a brick), and step six (collect a silk), you may now use this brick and silk to build a Silkwork with these resources (plus the money needed of course).

There is no capital on the map so players may start wherever they like at the start of the game, but once they have build at least one fanctory, all new boats must be deployed from there, so the action taken by the tribune will be the same as the colonist one in that aspect. Also note that multiple boats may occupy the regions and land colonist can land on the same place in the track.

The other cards in the game pretty much functions the same, and there are a total of 10 different regions on the map.

The rewards for the steps are; Brick, Wheat, 3 money, Tools, Wine, Silk, and a new card (which you have to pay full price for, kind of like a mini-senator).</figcaption>

#### Concordia -Mare Nostrum release date
The release date is still unclear, but if we were to guess, the map is probably coming out some time in 2026, maybe as early as summer.
