### Components

200 Cards in total
- 8 Heroes 
- 3 Double sided Masterminds (One normal side, and one Epic side for a bigger challenge.)
- 4 Villain Groups
- 2 Henchmen Groups
- 4 Veiled or Unveiled Schemes
- 7 x 2 Special Sidekicks
- 3 Special Bystanders


#### Overview

The Marvel Legendary - Messiah Complex expansion came out 2022, and is by date the latest Non-MCU "Deluxe Expansion", as in an expansion with 200 cards, and todat we're having a closer look. It resolves around the X-men story line with the same name, and does indeed contain a hero or two from the **X-Men** faction, along with a couple of welcomed heroes for the **X-Force** faction, and a bunch from the new **X-Factor** team. As usual, it comes with a set of Masterminds, Henchmen and Villains as well. One unique thing is that this set also contains 14 **Special Sidekick** cards, which where introduced in the *Secret Wars, Volume 1* set from 2015, and special schemes called **Veiled or unveild schemes**, more on that below

  <div class="col-9 col-12-small">

 #### New keywords
 
- **Clone**. This keyword appears when recuited, as in if you can satisfy the pre-requisite, you may **Clone** the card, meaning you will get another copy of it from the HQ or the hero deck. It may also appear when you play a certain card, and in that case, you will get the copy of the card there and then. I was sceptical of this mechanic beforehand as it seemed very fiddly, but it actually works pretty well. 
- **Shatter**. You may use this mechanic to slice the strength of a villain in half, and some cards even lets you do this on the Mastermind! Obviosly super useful, especially against high strenth Mastermands like Thanos.
- **Tactical Formation**. This keyword appears on some hero cards and says things like “Tactical Formation 445: You get +3 stars“. This means, if you have two cards that costs 4 and one that costs 5 in play/in your hand, you would get +3 stars. Some characters in this set goes very well with characters like Spiderman from the base set (Tactical formation 223 for an example...)
- **Prey**. A complicated keyword that appears on villains and masterminds. It usually is an ambush effect, and when it triggers, you will put the card in question in front of a player, and if noone defeats the villain before that players turn has ended, it will trigger the **“Finish the Prey”** effect which could mean things like KOing cards, discarding cards, or get wounds, etc.
- **Veiled or unveild schemes**. These are double sided schemes that work like this; There's one "start side" and one "ending side", you will pick one scheme and use it's start side, at some point it will **Transform** to another random unveild cards ending side. There are 4 of these so there are 16 combinations to be found here, if our math serves us right.

 #### Returning keywords
 - **Investigaste** First seen in *Marvel Noir*, and it basically means you will check the top 2 cards of your deck to find X, where X can be a hero type, a hero with a certain cost, etc. If you manage to find one, put it in your hand.
 - **Chivalrous Duel** I'm not sure in which expansion this first appeared, but it means something in the lines of "You cannot Fight this Villain/Mastermind with cards from more than 1 hero", as in you could use a strenth 2 and a strength 3 Hulk card to defeat a strength 5 Villain with this keyword, but not a strength 3 Hulk and strength 3 Captain American.  
 - **When Recruited** This is a effect which happens when you recruit the hero, in this expansion it is often used togheter with **Clone**.

 #### New Heroes
 - *M* -M is a member of the new faction X-Factor, all her cards costs 3 and she has **Tactical Formation** and **Investigate** that cares about cards costing 3. All in all a decent, damage focused hero.
 - *Multiple Man* -Another X-Factor hero, and all his cards costs 4. Those are a bit expensive, sure, but all his cards have the **Clone** keyword, so you will end up getting alot of them for free. He also uses **Tactical Formation** and **Investigate**, much like M. I would call this guy a support hero as he lets you draw and KO cards, along with some decent damage output.
 - *Rictor* -His super card is awesome, either lets you **Shatter** the Mastermind, or all the heroes in the HQ, as in halving their prices. He has blue/yellow cards with more Shatter and **Investigate**. A very good hero. (X-Factor)
 - *Shatterstar* -The first X-Force hero in the bunch, and most of his cards costs 5. Most of the cards can be **Cloned** when buying them though, and you'll be using **Tactical Formation** to get the most of his cards. He also lets you **Shatter** the Mastermind. All in all, a very decent hero, that probably can go well with Thor and Wolverine from the base set.
 - *Siryn* -Another X-Factor hero, and she's all about **Shattering** the villains, the heroes, and the Mastermind. Awesome Red/blue hero
 - *Stepford Cuckoos* -Probably our last favorite hero(s) of the set. Their cards all costs 3 and 2, and they're using **Tactical Formation** and **Clone** on pretty much all of them, they're the only X-men in the set, and they probably go well with vanilla Spiderman.
 - *Strong Guy* -All all in green hero with awesome attack cards, and he uses **Investigate** in cool ways to make him a high tier hero. X-Factor
 - *Warpath* - His super card get stronger the more you "reveal" or "look at" cards, which is useful in combation with **Investigate** which he also has. He also has 4 interesting cards that does nothing except lets you draw 2 more cards next turn.... (X-Force)

 #### Masterminds & Villains
 - *Bastion, fused Sentinel* -A cool, medium level Mastermind that spawns another Mastermind every time you fight him, and Master Strikes also spawns a new mastermind, and makes ALL Sentinel Masterminds stronger... A very fun Mastermind that scales well.
 - *Exodus* -The bad news is he's 32 strength Mastermind. The good news is he can bed **Shattered** any number of times paying 3 stars. Quite challenging, and even more on the Epic side, obviously.
 - *Lady Deathstrike* -She's all about **Preying** on the players, and her villains all uses the **Prey** mechanic too, which in our opinion is pretty fiddly. The easiest and our least favorite Mastermind of the bunch.
 
There's one more Villain group that doesn't belong to a Mastermind included in the set, the *Clan Yashida*, which are all about the **Chivalrous Duel** and a welcome addition to the Villain pool.

#### Special Sidekicks
The set includes two copies each of 7 different Sidekicks that use mechanics from the set in a very nice way. For sure the best Sidekicks in the series so far! Two thumbs up.

### OPINION
#### The good
- The new heroes and keywords are all in all a solid bunch. Me liksie
- Interesting Masterminds, with three different difficulty levels, and also double sided.
- The **Special Sidekicks** are awesome.
- 200 cards is always nice.
- Nice artwork on the cards.

##### The bad
- The **Prey** mechanic, and the **Clone** mechanic, to some extent, are quite fiddly.

### CONCLUSION
Overall a solid expansion which won't disapoint you. 
**Rating: 8/10**  
*Thanks to Upper Deck who were nice enough to send me a copy to review!*
