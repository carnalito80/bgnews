A refreshing new addition to the Legendary system, Legendary - Game of Thrones is coming up! It features more of a player vs player play style where each player have their own mastermind the other players are trying to defeat, very exciting stuff, indeed.

Players will all have a private deck of market cards from where they can recruit cards, and there will be a central market deck as well. Then, they will use their cards to spawn them like villains on a central "city-board", called the "Battlefield" to gain victory points etc, and they will use their cards to battle other players "villain" cards, and of course, also defeat the other players Mastermind(s). It also looks like the Battlefield will have different "ranges", like claw, sword, and bow, and probably there will be cards that are stronger on different kind of space. A card with the **Sword-mastery** keyword will probably get bonuses if spawned on a Sword location. The Battlefield with give you vicotry points in forms of tokens, which can be interacted with, as in stolen by other players card effects, etc. Furthermore, there is also a deck of event cards that will spice things up like Dornish pepper.

The playercount have been reported to be 2 to 4 players, but I wouldn't be suprised to see that count rise as expansions to this game will be released.
