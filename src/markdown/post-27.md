### Cascadia: Landmarks
In Cascadia: Landmarks, the first expansion for the excellent game Cascadia, players will place something called landmarks that will give the environments a unique look and feel, while providing additional endgame scoring bonuses. Our guess is that things like waterfalls and giant tree groves might the type of landmarks we are talking about here, interesting stuff.

The expansion will also include more of the base game components to allow 5-6 players, which by itself will be a welcome addition.

Furthermore, Cascadia: Landmarks will include a couple of more scoring cards for even more variety!

#### Cascadia: Landmarks release
So, when and how will this expansion be released? Will it be Kickstarted, or what? No, according the publisher, AEG, Cascadia: Landmarks will be releases directly to retail, "in the fall of 2023", so our guess it sometime in October. Or perhaps in time for Essen? As soon as more info emerges, we will keep you posted.

Also, according to AEG, the expansion will fit inside the basegame box, if you remove the insert.
