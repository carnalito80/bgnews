Game Brewer has the pleasure announce the launch of their new board game, Stroganov, on Kickstarter, coming this February 15. 

Designed by Andreas Resch (Gùgōng, Hansa Teutonica) and illustrated by Maciej Janik (Robinson Crusoe, Prêt-à-porter), this medium heavy strategic euro game is sure to thrill the fans of the genre! Here is a brief description from the publisher: 

>In the 17th century, Russia began to expand eastwards to develop the vast expanses of Siberia. This phase in history is closely associated with the name Stroganov.  
>In the game, players try to collect the best furs to gain wealth and fame as they move across the vastness that is Siberia. They will journey through Siberia, in spring, summer, and autumn before returning home each winter. After 4 years (rounds) the player who has best utilized their actions, and collected the most victory points, will win the game.  
>Each year, the players must move eastward across the landscape. They can spend horses if they wish to travel further. Once they have advanced, they may take a basic action, such as collecting furs or coins, trading … Lastly, they may take more advanced actions such as visiting a village, setting up a yurt, taking a Tsar’s wish (card), setting up a hunting lodge, or buying a landscape field. All of these actions, combined with exploring and some storytelling along the way will earn players victory points at the end of the game. Every winter, players will return home to Tyumen to prepare for a new year.  
>After 4 years, the game comes to an end. Players will score a whole bunch of victory points based on having collected the right Landscape tiles, fulfilled Tsar's wishes, built hunting lodges, collected furs, and more.
