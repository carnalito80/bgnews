### Overview 
In Astroyale, players are dealt 10 cards each round and will take turns playing cards to a central pile, much like traditional games, like  Mau-Mau, Switch, Crazy eights and so on. The twist here though is that if you cannot play a card, you are eliminated from the game, and you remaining cards will be dealt to the rest of the players, which also scores points. After that play goes on until there is one sole survivor, which will score more points, and then you will go for another round.
After 5 rounds of play, players tally up their score and whoever has the most points will be the "new Center of the Universe".

The game is said to be playable by all ages, from kids to grandmas and will support 2 to 5 players, and take about 30 minutes to play. It has some lovely artwork and like previously stated, designed by new-comer from Hawaii, a mister *Bennet Gehring-Nobbe*. The game is currently avaible on Crowd Sale which is kind of like Kickstarter but it means the game is already done, and the more people who buys it, the cheaper it will be! So head on over to https://www.thegamecrafter.com/crowdsale/astroyale and check it out.
