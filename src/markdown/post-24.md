The expansion will take place in the "Rise of the Midnight Sons" story line from the 90:s which consisted of several books with characters like Morbius, Blade, Frank Drake, Danny Ketch as Ghostrider, among others. The team got togheter to stop the mighty "mother of all demons", Lilith from getting resurrected. So our guess is that these characters will be included in the set. Also, there's a video coming out, <a href="https://midnightsuns.2k.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Midnight Suns</a>, which has to do with the same story line. One would suspect this might be connected to this somehow.
This expansion is said to be released in March -23, and it will consist of the standard 100 cards. The said release date is very likely to change, thought, as the Legendary series has been plagued by delays for quite some time now.
Anyway, back to the information about Midnight Sons. Besides Lilith as a Mastermind, the demon **Zarathos** is very likely to join her in making players lives miserable:

Zarathos is likely to lead *The Fallen* and Lilith is bound to have the *Children of Lilith* with her. These are all speculations so far, of course, but are pretty sure these will show up in what looks like a great **Marvel Legendary** expansion.

So, without further ado, here's our speculations among with the stuff that has been more or less confirmed:

 ###Heroes###
 - Morbius (confirmed)
 - Blade (confirmed)
 - Werewolf by Night (confirmed)
 - Ghost Rider in some form
 - Dr. Strange is some fancy form

 ###Masterminds###
 - Lilith (confirmed)
 - Zarathos

###Villains###
- Children of Lilith
- The Fallen

###Keywords###
- Dark Memories
- Walking Nightmare
- Rise of the Living Dead (returning from Marvel Legendary: Secret Wars #1)

###Plots###
- Something to do with the Medalion of Power
- Rip open the walls to Shadowside
