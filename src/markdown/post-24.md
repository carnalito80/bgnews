The expansion will take place in the "Rise of the Midnight Sons" story line from the 90:s which consisted of several books with characters like Morbius, Blade, Frank Drake, Danny Ketch as Ghostrider, among others. The team got togheter to stop the mighty "mother of all demons", Lilith from getting resurrected. So our guess is that these characters will be included in the set. Also, there's a video coming out, <a href="https://midnightsuns.2k.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Midnight Suns</a>, which has to do with the same story line. One would suspect this might be connected to this somehow.
This expansion is said to be released in March -23, and it will consist of the standard 100 cards.

So, without further ado, here's our speculations among with the stuff that has been more or less confirmed:

 ###Heroes###
 - Morbius (confirmed)
 - Blade (confirmed)
 - Werewolf by Night (confirmed)
 - Ghost Rider
 - Dr. Strange is some fancy form

 ###Masterminds###
 - Lilith
 - Zarathos

###Villains###
- Children of Lilith
- The Fallen

###Keywords###
- Dark Memories
- Walking Nightmare
- Something new

As soon as we get more news on this, we will update the post.
