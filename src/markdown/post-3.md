This expansion takes the fighting against the Old ones to Tasmania, like the name would suggest. It is designed for 1 or 2 players, and is playable iwth 3 if playing with the *Revenge of the Old Ones* expansion. It has two sides, one that is fixed with resources and Old Ones, and the other one is randomized through a set of terrain tiles. As always, this promises great solo play.
