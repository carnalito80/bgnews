**Great Western Trail: El Paso** takes place in, wait for it, **El Paso** in the late 19th century.
 Five different railroad companies have connected the Sun City to their networks, making it a major hub for the cattle trade. Ranchers from surrounding Texas and Mexico dtake their cattle through the city to send them further on the journey north, east and west across the US.

In Great Western Trail: El Paso, you take on the role of a rancher of the past and bring your best cattle to El Paso to earn money and profit points. Players will hire more cowboys, builders and engineers to get closer to their goals, just like the other titles in the series. But unlike the others, this one promises shorter playtime and a much lighter experience for the unexperienced players, and even families.
