In Heroes of Barcadia, two to six players take on the roles of Barcadian champions to battle monsters and bosses, collect Power-Ups with mystical abilities, and race to collect the elusive Drink Hoard hidden in the dungeon! There is a special twist to this drinking game: your character’s health is measured by the liquid in your cup. Getting hit by a monster forces you to take a drink, slowly sipping down your health pool until it’s back to square one.

###How to Play
Heroes of Barcadia features a fun and cartoony art style, with dozens of unique monsters like
The Wicked Witch of the Yeast, Hopgoblins, and the fearsome Mimosasaurus. The game mixes
luck of the dice with strategic decisions in a ruleset that’s easy to pick up but still allows for
higher-level play. The dungeon itself is tile based and built by the players at the start of each
game, making each session different for a high level of replayability.
Choose from Barcadian champions like Sir Drankalot the Inebriated, or Intoxica the Necromixer,
taking their character glasses and moving them around the board, revealing dungeon tiles and
fighting monsters in your search for the Drink Hoard. Use devious Loot Cards to ruin your
opponent’s plans, all the while making sure your Health Bar Cup doesn’t run dry. Nice guys
finish last in this fast-paced, ever-changing, pun-tastic party game for fantasy and beverage
connoisseurs alike.
The first player to defeat the Grand Drink Guardian and secure the Drink Hoard is crowned the
true hero of Barcadia and wins the game! In the end, only one hero may claim the treasure, so
it’s a scramble to mess up your opponents’ plans while keeping your own character on the right
path.

The game will launch on Kickstarter the 7th of June, and the link is right [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rollacrit/heroes-of-barcadia).
