A StarCraft tabletop / board game is being developed as we speak in an official partnership between Archon Studio and Blizzard Entertainment. This collaboration will begin with a tabletop miniatures game launching in 2026, followed by board games set in the StarCraft universe in 2027.

The StarCraft Tabletop Miniatures Game will allow players to command their favorite factionsâ€”Terran, Zerg, and Protoss in tactical battles, staying true to the fast-paced and strategic essence of the beloved Real Time Strategy PC game. The game will feature high-quality miniatures, and deep faction customization, satisfying both StarCraft veterans and tabletop wargamers.

Further details will be revealed later this year, including previews of miniatures and gameplay mechanics. Stay tuned for updates as we bring the battle for the Koprulu Sector to tabletops worldwide!

As of now, very few details exists regardingthe board game, but rest assured that we will keep you updated.
